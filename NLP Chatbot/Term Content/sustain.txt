sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced fashion in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations .
for many in the field sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars environment economic and social .
subdomains of sustainable development have been considered also cultural technological and political .
while sustainable development may be the organizing principle for sustainability for some for others the two terms are paradoxical ie .
sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
brundtland report for the world commission on environment and development introduced the term of sustainable developmentsustainability can also be defined as a socioecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal .
however by persistently and dynamically approaching it the process results in a sustainable system .
moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails international and national law urban planning and transport local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism .
ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions eg ecovillages ecomunicipalities and sustainable cities reappraising economic sectors permaculture green building sustainable agriculture or work practices sustainable architecture using science to develop new technologies green technologies renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources .
the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
despite the increased popularity of the use of the term sustainability the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been and continues to be light of environmental degradation climate change overconsumption population growth and societies pursuit of unlimited economic growth in a closed system .
the name sustainability is derived from the latin sustinere tenere to hold sub under .
sustain can mean maintain support or endure .
since the sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development that of the brundtland commission of the united nations on march sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
the world summit on social development identified sustainable development goals such as economic development social development and environmental protection .
this view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing .
the three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years in particular in the food industry .
some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability or a quadruple bottom line .
one such pillar is future generations which emphasizes the longterm thinking associated with sustainability .
there is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability .
sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment .
the question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environmenta study from pointed out that environmental justice is as important as sustainable development .
this perspective led to the nested circles figure of economics inside society inside the environmentthe simple definition that sustainability is something that improves the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems though vague conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits .
but sustainability is also a call to action a task in progress or journey and therefore a political process so some definitions set out common goals and values .
the earth charter speaks of a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature universal human rights economic justice and a culture of peace .
this suggested a more complex figure of sustainability which included the importance of the domain of politicsmore than that sustainability implies responsible and proactive decisionmaking and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience economic prosperity political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future .
specific types of sustainability include sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture or ecological economics .
understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like liberty or justice .
while the united nations millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains economics environment and social sustainability .
more recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the circles of sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability this in accord with the united nations unesco agenda and in particular the agenda for culture which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development .
human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalitiesintegral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities .
it aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable .
additionally instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process .
resiliencethinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between humanconstructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive .
it is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life .
the resiliency of an ecosystem and thereby its sustainability can be reasonably measured at junctures or events where the combination of naturally occurring regenerative forces solar energy water soil atmosphere vegetation and biomass interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances .
a practical view of sustainability is closed systems that maintain processes of productivity indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems .
in this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced .
in analysing systems such as urban and national parks dams farms and gardens theme parks openpit mines water catchments one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a longterm vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events .
the history of sustainability traces humandominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present day .
this history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular society followed by crises that were either resolved producing sustainability or not leading to decline .
the philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields in recent years an area that has come to be called sustainability science has emerged .
sustainability is studied and managed over many scales levels or frames of reference of time and space and in many contexts of environmental social and economic organization .
the focus ranges from the total carrying capacity sustainability of planet earth to the sustainability of economic sectors ecosystems countries municipalities neighbourhoods home gardens individual lives individual goods and services clarification needed occupations lifestyles behaviour patterns and so on .
the sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability .
to shed light on the big picture explorer and sustainability campaigner jason lewis has drawn parallels to other more tangible closed systems .
these concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system .
for example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the circular economy and there are cases that require different or additional strategies like purchasing new more energy efficient equipment .
a review of a team of researchers from cambridge and tu delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy namely a conditional relation a strong conditional relation a necessary but not sufficient conditional relation a beneficial relationship a structured and unstructured subset relation a degree relation a costbenefittradeoff relation and a selective relation .
sustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability .
the metrics used for the measurement of sustainability involving the sustainability of environmental social and economic domains both individually and in various combinations are evolving they include indicators benchmarks audits sustainability standards and certification systems like fairtrade and organic indexes and accounting as well as assessment appraisal and other reporting systems .
some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting triple bottom line accounting world sustainability society circles of sustainability and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the environmental sustainability index and environmental performance indexcompanies such as lieef wwwlieefcom have started reporting esg metrics on behalf of companies and investment funds in an effort to increase transparency through patenting pending technology that measures emissions from a gross to net basis .
it is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability .
by over exploiting forests and fisheries the figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their ecological footprint with their un human development index a measure of standard of living .
the graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while at the same time maintaining sustainable resource use .
the general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable .
the sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels that is to not exceed one planet consumption .
information generated by reports at the national regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time .
romanian american economist nicholas georgescuroegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of earth that is earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use .
the enterprise scale carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations .
this is most clearly demonstrated through use of contextbased sustainability cbs tools methods and metrics including the multicapital scorecard which have been in development since .
contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations which tend to be more incrementalist in form cbs is explicitly tied to social environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world .
thus rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another cbs makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organizationspecific norms standards or thresholds for what they the impacts would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable ie which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or nonhuman wellbeing .
the sustainable development goals sdgs are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targetsthe official agenda for sustainable development adopted on september has paragraphs with the main paragraph outlining the sustainable development goals and its associated targets .
the sustainable development goals sdgs replace the eight millennium development goals mdgs which expired at the end of .
adopted by the united nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by to the data that member countries represented to the united nations cuba was the only country in the world in that met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development with an ecological footprint of less than hectares per capita and a human development index of over .
herman daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for nonrenewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment .
at the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans freshwater systems land and atmosphere but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden .
at the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities .
environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture organic farming and more sustainable business practices .
this impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production use and disposal more sustainable .
a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible .
the american public health association apha defines a sustainable food system as one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment .
a sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available accessible and affordable to all .
concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the obesity problems of the western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism .
at the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming .
at the local level there are various movements working towards local food production more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture urban horticulture local food slow food sustainable gardening and organic gardening .
sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired .
the sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methodsas global population and affluence has increased so has the use of various materials increased in volume diversity and distance transported .
developed countries citizens consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable .
sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of dematerialization converting the linear path of materials extraction use disposal in landfill to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature .
the use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on nonrenewables from a life cycle standpointsynthetic chemical production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second world war .
the european union is expected to table by the end of an ambitious circular economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management ecodesign and limits on land fillson one account sustainability concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons .
sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity .
sustainability economics represents a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective .
however the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare resources or profit margins .
at present the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to highconsumption western lifestyles .
the challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact .
while conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth fair distribution and efficient allocation in that order .
the world business council for sustainable development states that business can not succeed in societies that fail .
an economy that is able to sustain gdp growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled .
sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity the amount of resource eg .
consequently longterm sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total gdp remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by herman daly and others in the ecological economics communitya different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach .
treating the environment as an externality may generate shortterm profit at the expense of sustainability .
sustainable business practices on the other hand integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones ie the triple bottom line .
energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing coststhe idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the sustainability consortium of the society for organizational learning the sustainable business institute and the world council for sustainable development .
the expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of greencollar workers .
research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability and led to emergence of the concept of embedded sustainability by its authors chris laszlo and nadya zhexembayeva as incorporation of environmental health and social value into the core business with no tradeoff in price or other words with no social or green premium .
laszlo and zhexembayeva s research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation a better riskmanagement b increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use c better product differentiation d new market entrances e enhanced brand and reputation f greater opportunity to influence industry standards and g greater opportunity for radical innovation .
one school of thought often labeled ecosocialism or ecological marxism asserts that the capitalist economic system is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability .
lowrisk technologysciencebased solutions such as solar power sustainable agriculture and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient .
sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstableunsustainable .
ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by egalitarian economicpoliticalsocial structure designed to harmonize human society with nonhuman ecology and to fulfill human the only sufficient solution to the presentday ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability .
sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists environmental activists and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in nature what every environmentalist needs to know is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom through social struggle in order to create a whole new coevolution with the planet .
sustainability issues are generally expressed in scientific and environmental terms as well as in ethical terms of stewardship but implementing change is a social challenge that entails among other things international and national law urban planning and transport local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism .
broadbased strategies for more sustainable social systems include improved education and the political empowerment of women especially in developing countries greater regard for social justice notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries and intergenerational equity .
this aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere .
a major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty .
the word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment .
for example teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy whereas using pet solar water disinfection would be .
also sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country s timber base .
another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as bridges to prosperity s use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in asia and africaaccording to murray bookchin the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies .
reduce encroachment upon natureone approach to sustainable living exemplified by smallscale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages seeks to create selfreliant communities based on principles of simple living which maximize selfsufficiency particularly in food production .
other approaches loosely based around new urbanism are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport and zero emission housing .
in sustainable architecture the recent movement of new classical architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design .
the concept of circular flow land use management has also been introduced in europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawllarge scale social movements can influence both community choices and the built environment .
ecomunicipalities take a systems approach based on sustainability principles .
in sweden more than cities and per cent of all municipalities in the adopted a common set of sustainability principles and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations .
there are now twelve ecomunicipalities in the united states and the american planning association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles .
but the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes at all levels and contexts of society .
the united nations has recognised the central role of education and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development which aims to challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future .
the worldwide fund for nature proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic societal values headon and strengthen people s connections with the natural world .
application of social sustainability requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights prevention of human trafficking and other human rights risks .
the international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services .
the cultural dimension of sustainability is known as cultural sustainability .
feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism as the maximisation of existential felt authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits .

i will be sharing the stories of individuals and organizations that are implementing new environmental education programs and creating the green jobs of the future and we re preparing to unveil videos submitted through the youth sustainability challenge .
please send us your stories of sustainability this week on facebook and twitter using the hashtag epario so that we can share them with the worldeven if you can t be there in person i hope you will join online .
go to http to see and participate in all of the events being hosted by the us government and be a part of our efforts to build a better more sustainable and more prosperous futureabout the author lisa jackson is the administrator of the us environmental protection agencyeditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .
sustainability is a broad discipline giving students and graduates insights into most aspects of the human world from business to technology to environment and the social sciences .
sustainability draws on politics economics and philosophy and other social sciences as well as the hard sciences .
sustainability skills and environmental awareness is a priority in many corporate jobs at graduate level and over as businesses seek to adhere to new legislation .
therefore sustainability graduates will go into many fields but most commonly civic planning environmental consultancy built and natural environment agriculture not for profit corporate strategies health assessment and planning and even into law and decision making .
when we hear the word sustainability we tend to think of renewable fuel sources reducing carbon emissions protecting environments and a way of keeping the delicate ecosystems of our planet in balance .
in short sustainability looks to protect our natural environment human and ecological health while driving innovation and not compromising our way of life .
because of this growing requirement a master s will not necessarily be required for most jobs as bachelor s programs and in some cases lower than this prepares people for a career in sustainability .
read more about the various sustainability degrees and educationthe definition of sustainability is the study of how natural systems function remain diverse and produce everything it needs for the ecology to remain in balance .
it also acknowledges that human civilisation takes resources to sustain our modern way of life .
sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us protecting it from damage and destructionwe now live in a modern consumerist and largely urban existence throughout the developed world and we consume a lot of natural resources every day .
that s not to say that sustainable living should only focus on people who live in urban centres though there are improvements to be made everywhere it is estimated that we use about more resources every year than we can put back and that needs to change .
sustainability and sustainable development focuses on balancing that fine line between competing needs our need to move forward technologically and economically and the needs to protect the environments in which we and others live .
sustainability is not just about the environment it s also about our health as a society in ensuring that no people or areas of life suffer as a result of environmental legislation and it s also about examining the longer term effects of the actions humanity takes and asking questions about how it may be improved in the world summit on social development identified three core areas that contribute to the philosophy and social science of sustainable development .
it is also about providing incentives for businesses and other organisations to adhere to sustainability guidelines beyond their normal legislative requirements .
the biggest hot topic for many people right now is sustainable housing and how we can better build the homes we live in from sustainable material .
the final element is education encouraging people to participate in environmental sustainability and teaching them about the effects of environmental protection as well as warning of the dangers if we can not achieve our goals we all know what we need to do to protect the environment whether that is recycling reducing our power consumption by switching electronic devices off rather than using standby by walking short journeys instead of taking the bus .
it defines how we should study and protect ecosystems air quality integrity and sustainability of our resources and focusing on the elements that place stress on the environment .
it also concerns how technology will drive our greener future the epa recognized that developing technology and biotechnology is key to this sustainability and protecting the environment of the future from potential damage that technological advances could potentially bring the sustainable development professional network thinks acts and works globally .
in the united nations conference on sustainable development met to discuss and develop a set of goals to work towards they grew out of the millennium development goals mdg that claimed success in reducing global poverty while acknowledging there was still much more to do .
slash and burn farming replaced natural wilderness often with uniform crop plantation and camps gave way to settlements then eventually villages towns and cities which would put pressure on the environmentsometimes the environmental pressures forced people into making these changes in the first place growing human population being one of those pressures and often eventually they had to move on to somewhere new where the environmental could better sustain them and their practices or make further changes to their existing environment .
there was no real concept of sustainable living even if the people of the distant past understood that soil had a maximum fertility that could be exhausted and replenished with livestockit is widely acknowledged that many societies collapsed due to an inability to adapt to the conditions brought on by these unsustainable practices .
cultural change often led to survival of those societies beyond what might have been expected under the circumstances though some renaissance and enlightenment philosophers would express concern about resources and overpopulation and whether these were sustainable in the long term these people were not taken seriously at the time other than as a hypothetical question .
today their remit is to contribute to the building of peace the eradication of poverty sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education the sciences culture communication and information by the late century the science of climate change was firmly established .
it was then that we saw the the social economic and scientific birth of the environmental movementit is not yet clear what our sustainable future will look like but with emerging technologies and the improvement of older cleaner fuel sources many people now look to a post fossil fuel world including businesses .
it s vital that we develop new cleaner technologies to cope with our energy demands but sustainability is not just about the environmentthe biggest social activism movement related to the social development side of sustainability has been programs such as fair trade and the rainforest alliance in encouraging good farming practices while ensuring farmers who produce luxury goods such as coffee and cocoa receive a decent living wage .

log in sitemap skip to content text version contact usthere is no universally agreed definition on what sustainability means .
the idea of sustainability stems from the concept of sustainable development which became common language at the world s first earth summit in rio in .
the original definition of sustainable development is usually considered to be development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
many argue that sustainability has been hijacked and twisted to suit government and business that really want to continue with business as usualthe quotes below will provide some ideas on what constitutes sustainable development and sustainability .
a process of change in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations the world commission on environment and development sustainable development is a dynamic process which enables people to realise their potential and improve their quality of life in ways which simultaneously protect and enhance the earth s life support systems forum for the future in essence sustainable development is about five key principles quality of life fairness and equity participation and partnership care for our environment and respect for ecological constraints recognising there are environmental limits and thought for the future and the precautionary principle .
from making london work by forum for the future s sustainable wealth london project the environment must be to preserve essential ecosystem functions and to provide for the wellbeing of future generations environmental and economic policy must be integrated the goal of policy should be an improvement in the overall quality of life not just income growth poverty must be ended and resources distributed more equally and all sections of society must be involved in decision making .
the real world coalition a definition based on the work of the world commission on environment and development we can not just add sustainable development to our current list of things to do but must learn to integrate the concepts into everything that we do .

sustainability is something everyone can work towards whether it is picking up garbage you see on the street or boycotting a company that practices environmentally harmful business methods we all can make a difference .
un decade of education for sustainable development the overall goal of the un decade of education for sustainable development desd is to integrate the principles values and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning .
this educational effort will encourage changes in behaviour that will create a more sustainable future in terms of environmental integrity economic viability and a just society for present and future generations .
social life is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching sustainability and sustainable development .
social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainabilitythere are several approaches to sustainability .
the first which posits a triad of environmental sustainability economic sustainability and social sustainability is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability .
the concept of social sustainability in this approach encompasses such topics as social equity livability health equity community development social capital social support human rights labour rights placemaking social responsibility social justice cultural competence community resilience and human adaptationa second more recent approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social including ecological economic political and cultural sustainability .
these domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural with the ecological domain defined as human embeddedness in the environment .
in these terms social sustainability encompasses all human activities .
see the venn diagram and the circles of sustainability diagram according to the western australia council of social services wacoss social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes systems structures and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities .
socially sustainable communities are equitable diverse connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life .
they define social sustainability as a process for creating sustainable successful places that promote wellbeing by understanding what people need from the places they live and work .
social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world infrastructure to support social and cultural life social amenities systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve .
social life have developed a framework for social sustainability which has four dimensions amenities and infrastructure social and cultural life voice and influence and space to grow .
nobel laureate amartya sen gives the following dimensions for social sustainability also we can speak of sustainable human development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations .
the different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in socially responsible investing sri .
social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by sri funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include community diversity employee relations human rights product safety reporting and governance structure .
in addition resources like the global reporting initiative and business and human rights resource centre all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability .
certifications from internationally recognized and accredited organizations are available to aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services .
design for social sustainability sets out a framework for planning and designing the service spaces housing and governance arrangements to help local communities to thrivesocial sustainability is largely neglected in mainstream sustainability debates .
priority has been given to economic and environmental sustainability in particular in the context of urban planning and housing where policy and investment has focused on renewable resources low carbon communities and encouraging proenvironmental household behaviours .
as a result there are few practical resources that directly address the question of how to create places that are socially sustainable as well as physical infrastructure that is environmentally sustainable .

circles of social life is an approach that guides engaged and collaborative practice in making our cities locales and organizations more sustainable resilient adaptable and liveable .
as part of this overall approach circles of sustainability provides practical tools for creating sustainable cities and communities .
for example instead of designating a pregiven set of indicators the approach sets out a process for deciding upon indicators and analysing the relationship between themthis is all developed in detail in a book that forms the basis of this website published by routledge called urban sustainability in theory and practice circles of sustainabilitythe circles approach provides tools for responding to four key questions .
social life is rarely enacted as a straight line of cause and effecthow can we best depict the sustainability resilience adaptability and liveability of our cities .
the resulting profiles remain simple on the surface even as they encourage deep researchwhat possible practical pathways should we take in the process of developing a positive response to issues of sustainability resilience adaptability and liveability process circles guide practitioners through logical pathways for carrying out a project large or small .
sustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability .
the metrics used for the measurement of sustainability involving the sustainability of environmental social and economic domains both individually and in various combinations are still evolving they include indicators benchmarks audits indexes and accounting as well as assessment appraisal and other reporting systems .
some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting triple bottom line accounting and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the environmental sustainability index and environmental performance index .
an alternative approach used by the united nations global compact cities programme and explicitly critical of the triplebottomline approach is circles of sustainabilitythe principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policymaking as part of the process of sustainability governance .
sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socioeconomic activities .
societal r esponses policy guided by sustainability indicators can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of eventsthe united nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement tools in relation to sustainable development as well as a system of integrated environmental and economic accounting .
in the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability including measures of resource use like life cycle assessment measures of consumption like the ecological footprint and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the environmental performance index .
the following is a list of quantitative tools used by sustainability scientists the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade .

region would like to announce our regional award and certificate winners for three smm challenges and thank them for their great efforts and contributions toward improving our environment and our livesthe food recovery challenge frc partners pledge to improve their sustainable food management practices and report their results .
in region frc partners diverted tons of food from the landfill through their collective activitiesthe epa wastewise program encourages organizations to achieve sustainability in their practices and to reduce select industrial wastes .
participants demonstrate how they reduce waste practice environmental stewardship and incorporate sustainable materials management into their wastehandling processes .
before working in sustainable materials management she worked in indoor air programs and managed the asthma grants program for ten years .
additionally the impact of global climate change is addressed through local solutions thereby empowering the community to make a difference on the sustainability of our environmentthe environmental education project awarded in seeks to make lake county youth the environmental leaders of the community ultimately expanding lake county s capacity for environmental stewardship .
in past blogs we ve written about the water footprint of our food and ways that sustainable food management protects water resources .
epa is a partner in the local foods local places program which helps communities like allentown pennsylvania crisfield maryland and williamson west virginia stimulate economic development through local food enterpriseswith simple steps you can be a watersavvy home chef and still make mouths water at the dinner tableabout the author dr jennie saxe joined epa s midatlantic region in and works in the water protection division on sustainability programseditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .
no one deserves more credit than him for advancing the goals of sustainability .
this has prompted the current un secretary general ban kimoon to note that our struggle for global sustainability will be won or lost in cities today this is a flashing red lighttwenty years later maurice strong was key in organizing the rio earth summit .
since then he played a key role in many un activities helping to advance a more sustainable and resilient world .
after the earth summit strong continued to take a leading role in implementing the results of rio through dozens of international organizationsover his life time he strongly advanced the concept of sustainability .
today achieving the goal of sustainability is even more urgent .
it is here that epa can help shape and protect the future worldabout the author alan hecht is the director for sustainable development in epa s office of research and developmenteditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .
longterm recovery was a relatively new role for epa and involved providing assistance with sustainable community planning to make a community more sustainable and resilient to future disastersmy role in greensburg was to help fema develop the longterm community recovery plan which was completed after several months of work and quickly implemented eventually making greensburg arguably the greenest city in the countryin i was again assigned to work with fema in iowa on postdisaster sustainable longterm planning efforts .
fortunately then governor chet culver established a state government agency called the rebuild iowa office which spent considerable time immediately after the disaster working with fema to determine the longterm recovery needs of communitiesflooding in eastern iowa june learning from my experience in greensburg i started to reach out to various epa headquarters offices looking for assistance knowing there was no funding available from epa region to assist with the needed recovery planningi quickly found that epa s offices of sustainable communities and brownfields land revitalization were willing partners .
both provided funding to bring in technical experts on economic development transportation planning and sustainable urban designiowa city makes the most of epa s assistancethe iowa community that took most advantage of these resources was iowa city the state s fourth largest city and home to the university of iowa and a major medical center .
the flood gave them an opportunity to do just thatthis area renamed the riverfront crossings district includes an aging wastewater treatment plant recycling center animal shelter and various other underutilized properties many of which were impacted by the floodingdiagram from epa s enhancing sustainable communities with green infrastructure after conducting a retail and housing market analysis along with a transitoriented development study both commissioned by epa it was decided that this area could be transformed into a mixeduse pedestrian and transitfriendly neighborhood .
again utilizing epa funding contractors with expertise in sustainable urban planning initiated a process to develop conceptual plans for such a neighborhood .
a number of street improvement projects are also in the planning stagesthe old saying with disaster brings opportunity certainly couldn t be more applicable to the sustainable recovery efforts that rejuvenated iowa city after the flood of the author david doyle serves as the sustainable communities coordinator at epa region .
by dr alan d hecht and barb waltonlate last year columbia university economist jeffrey sachs pronounced the year of sustainable development reflecting the united nations efforts to identify goals and agree on greenhouse gas emission targets for the decades aheadthe increase in greenhouse gas emissions and anticipated yet unquantifiable impact on climate change is one of many major global trends that governments at all levels and corporations need to addressthe full suite of such global mega trends challenges all of us to find ways to achieve years of sustainable development epa the world environment center and the wilson center are hosting an earth day seminar april from to pm on mega trends to encourage discussion of the following joining us to share thoughts and lead the discussion will be jennifer turner of the wilson center banning garrett adjunct faculty at singularity university and terry yosie of the world environment centertogether we will share our views on such topics as projected trends and impacts from climate change extreme weather urban growth and energy land and water useepa has been leading the responsive to a number of such emerging issues notably to climate change the management of new chemical wastes such as endocrine disruptors and nanomaterials the evaluation of biofuels and the effectiveness of green infrastructure .
accordingly the agency has developed a set of principles and actions to advance energywater use in a more sustainable wayand on urban growth epa is attuned to the potential impact on human health and on disadvantaged communities .
epa has identified communities where it will work to respond to past present and future issue affecting society wellbeingthe challenge of achieving sustainable development requires multiagency cooperation businessgovernment partnerships and full public understanding of the potential impacts .
to prepare for earth day in and for years of sustainable development we need to we and our partners are meeting those challenges .

sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends .
sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generationswhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the brundtland report it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns .
it has been suggested that the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good .
the economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called managed sustainable development msd the concept of sustainable development has still to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development .
it has been argued weasel words that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth s finite stock .
citation needed sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity or human replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems .
sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity .
sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science .
development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the and centuries .
building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jeanbaptiste colbert von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield .
one of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the club of rome in in its classic report on the limits to growth written by a group of scientists led by dennis and donella meadows of the massachusetts institute of technology .
describing the desirable state of global equilibrium the authors wrote we are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people .
following the club of rome report an mit research group prepared ten days of hearings on growth and its implication for the future roundtable press for the us congress the first hearings ever held on sustainable development .
citation needed in the international union for the conservation of nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term sustainable development .
the report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development .
since the brundtland report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth .
in the un conference on environment and development published the earth charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the century .
the action plan agenda for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars .
it emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information .
furthermore agenda emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development .
under the principles of the united nations charter the millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection .
broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations .
the term sustainable development as used by the united nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education public health and standard of living .
citation needed a study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains ecology economics politics and culture .
in september the united nations general assembly formally adopted the universal integrated and transformative agenda for sustainable development a set of sustainable development goals sdgs .
the goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year to development or sustainability has been described in terms of three spheres dimensions domains or pillars ie .
also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health .
fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species .
environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive .
environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet .
this for example entails using water sustainably utilizing renewable energy and sustainable material supplies eg .
sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally .
inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity .
theoretically the longterm result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life .
citation needed integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities .
a telling example is the european environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development .
a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible .
because left unaddressed the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way .
so this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal usesustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems .
the concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted .
elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture agroforestry mixed farming multiple cropping and crop rotation .
citation needed numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist including organic certification rainforest alliance fair trade utz certified bird friendly and the common code for the coffee community .
sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption .
issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of longterm outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation .
as early as the the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems .
in the economist edward barbier published the study the concept of sustainable economic development where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other .
a world bank study from concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in macroeconomics or purely environmental .
the study interpreting sustainability in economic terms found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage intergenerational equity and dynamic efficiency .
but gilbert rist points out that the world bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem .
he writes from this angle sustainable development looks like a coverup operation .
the thing that is meant to be sustained is really development not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies .
but they did not want to hear about how things really are or what i find in my work a meta review in looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of sustainability policies .
it has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics .
misum mistra center for sustainable markets based at stockholm school of economics aims to provide policy research and advice to swedish and international actors on sustainable markets .
misum is a crossdisciplinary and multistakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms sustainability in financial markets mistra financial systems sustainability in production and consumption and sustainable socioeconomic development .

sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development .
according to a series of reports by the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp sustainable transport can help create jobs improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient .
it also offers a practical opportunity to save people s time and household income as well as government budgets making investment in sustainable transport a winwin opportunitysome western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both longterm and shortterm implementations .
such as other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidencebased sustainable transportation policies .
citation needed the most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm s efficient use of natural capital .
this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd under the following definition ecoefficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the lifecycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity desimone and popoff .
similar to the ecoefficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability .
citation needed both ecoefficiency and socioefficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability .
however as dyllick and hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development .
they point towards ecoeffectiveness socioeffectiveness sufficiency and ecoequity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached .

in sustainable architecture the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design .
it should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain .
citation needed a study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policymaking .
the international institute for sustainable development has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics .
the framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable developmentthe united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance .
they have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics this accords with the brundtland commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triplebottomline dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society .
in this context the agenda for culture and the united cities and local governments uclg executive bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement culture fourth pillar of sustainable development passed on november in the framework of the world summit of local and regional leaders world congress of uclg held in mexico city .
this document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies .
the circles of sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability .
other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development .
the network of excellence sustainable development in a diverse world sponsored by the european union integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development .
the fourth pillar of sustainable development theory has been referenced by executive director of imi institute at unesco vito di bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement neofuturism whose name was inspired by the united nations report our common future .
the circles of sustainability approach used by metropolis defines the fourth cultural domain as practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning .
the united nations conference on sustainable development uncsd also known as rio was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community .
an outcome of this conference was the development of the sustainable development goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world .
however few nations met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development criteria established in .
in a report for the us environmental protection agency stated while much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable .
at best they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction or that our current activities are not sustainable .
nevertheless a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible .
however a more general criticism is coming from the project management community how can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we can not monitor it in any single project .
the cubanborn researcher and entrepreneur sonia bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral longterm costbenefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project activity or enterprise .
furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources .
citation needed reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen us green building council s usgbc leadership in energy and environmental design leed .
the goals presented by leed design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality .
although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building .
the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be nonsubstitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible .
citation needed main page education for sustainable developmenteducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable .
this vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education an empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony .
when nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives a quiet revolution is set in motion education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering finance supply chain and operations is gaining weightage .
multiple institutes including wharton columbia casi global new york offer certifications in sustainabilitycorporate s prefer employees certified in sustainability .
referencehttps wwwwhartonupenneduhttp wwwcolumbiaeduhttp casiglobalusit has been argued that since the the concept of sustainable development has changed from conservation management to economic development whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat .
in effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developersbut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of nonrenewable resources like minerals .
thus environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall sustainable development in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources it makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates .
one critic has argued that the brundtland commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of sustainable development attached as a public relations slogan the report on our common future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders .
since the publication of the report the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of sustainable development has marched on worldwide .

bateson had tried to bridge the natureculture divide the majority of studies focused on investigating processes within the social domain only treating the ecosystem largely as a black box and assuming that if the social system performs adaptively or is well organised institutionally it will also manage the environmental resource base in a sustainable fashion .
ses theory incorporates ideas from theories relating to the study of resilience robustness sustainability and vulnerability eg .
the concept of resilience is a promising tool for analysing adaptive change towards sustainability because it provides a way for analysing how to manipulate stability in the face of changein order to emphasise the key requirements of a socialecological system for successful adaptive governance folke and colleagues contrasted case studies from the florida everglades and the grand canyon .
the concept of socialecological systems has been developed in order to provide both a promising scientific gain as well as impact on problems of sustainable development .
problems of sustainable development are intrinsically tied to the socialecological system defined to tackle them .
china was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy .
for china to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies .
environmentally friendly or environmentfriendly also referred to as ecofriendly naturefriendly and green are sustainability and marketing terms referring to goods and services laws guidelines and policies that claim reduced minimal or no harm upon ecosystems or the environment .
it is thus linked to environmental protection sustainability and integrated landscape managementenvironmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global sociopolitical frameworks such as the brundtland commission s our common future which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and international development and the worldwatch institute s annual state of the world reportsthe environment determines the nature of people animals plants and places around the earth affecting behaviour religion culture and economic practicesenvironmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives .
with the prevalence of environmental problems many economists embraced the notion that if environmental sustainability must coexist for economic sustainability then the overall system must permit identification of an equilibrium between the environment and the economy .
simply put carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of organisms a particular resource can sustain .
sustainability in environmental resource management involves managing economic social and ecological systems both within and outside an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in .
in context sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on a finite planet development improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources .
sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stakeholders .
the end result should be a symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization community and environmentmany drivers compel environmental resource management to take sustainability issues into account .
as an exceptionally powerful contributing factor to social and environmental change the modern organisation has the potential to apply environmental resource management with sustainability principals to achieve highly effective outcomes .
to achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management an organisation should work within sustainability principles including social and environmental accountability longterm planning a strong shared vision a holistic focus devolved and consensus decision making broad stakeholder engagement and justice transparency measures trust and flexibility .
whether it be a matter of ethics or just strategic advantage organizations are internalizing sustainability principles .
some of the world s largest and most profitable corporations are shifting to sustainable environmental resource management ford toyota bmw honda shell du port sta toil swiss re hewlettpackard and unilever among others .
an extensive study by the boston consulting group reaching business leaders from diverse regions job positions expertise in sustainability industries and sizes of organizations revealed the many benefits of sustainable practice as well as its viability .
it is important to note that though sustainability of environmental resource management has improved corporate sustainability for one has yet to reach the majority of global companies operating in the markets .
the three major barriers to preventing organizations to shift towards sustainable practice with environmental resource management are not understanding what sustainability is having difficulty modeling an economically viable case for the switch and having a flawed execution plan or a lack thereof .
therefore the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization and to clarify the business case .
this has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors including other governments private and civil to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours .
