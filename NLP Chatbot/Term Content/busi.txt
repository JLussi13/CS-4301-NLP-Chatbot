we make our businesses and industries much more efficient by following this example .
by working on public outreach environmental pr specialists ensure that the public and local businesses are aware of all environmental regulations their importance and the consequences of ignoring these regulations .
their skills are practical requiring a broad knowledge of sustainability issues but with an understanding of the processes of business decisions costing human resources and the organization s scope also .
they build on the foundation laid by the mdgs seek to complete the unfinished business of the mdgs and respond to new challenges .
it stresses the need to change from old sectorcentered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve crosssectoral coordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes .
this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd under the following definition ecoefficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the lifecycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity desimone and popoff .
however as dyllick and hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development .
they postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a business as usual mentality .
one critic has argued that the brundtland commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of sustainable development attached as a public relations slogan the report on our common future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders .
an extensive study by the boston consulting group reaching business leaders from diverse regions job positions expertise in sustainability industries and sizes of organizations revealed the many benefits of sustainable practice as well as its viability .
therefore the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization and to clarify the business case .
