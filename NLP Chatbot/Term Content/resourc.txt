sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced fashion in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations .
ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentallyfriendly chemical engineering environmental resources management and environmental protection .
ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions eg ecovillages ecomunicipalities and sustainable cities reappraising economic sectors permaculture green building sustainable agriculture or work practices sustainable architecture using science to develop new technologies green technologies renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources .
there is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability .
it is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life .
a practical view of sustainability is closed systems that maintain processes of productivity indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems .
in this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced .
for example he likens human existence on earth isolated as the planet is in space whereby people can not be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources can not be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water .
a major driver of human impact on earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources and especially the earth s ecosystems .
the environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved .
careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services .
this formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components population numbers levels of consumption which it terms affluence although the usage is different and impact per unit of resource use which is termed technology because this impact depends on the technology used .
the equation is expressed in recent years concepts based on re cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance .
the reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution .
the ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen .
fossil fuels or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage eg .
the graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while at the same time maintaining sustainable resource use .
as always population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use .
the sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels that is to not exceed one planet consumption .
romanian american economist nicholas georgescuroegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of earth that is earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use .
thus rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another cbs makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organizationspecific norms standards or thresholds for what they the impacts would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable ie which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or nonhuman wellbeing .
this direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science environmental science and conservation biologyhowever this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption so a second approach is through demand management of human resource usemanagement of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics .
herman daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for nonrenewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment .
due to the water cycle fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource .
feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the earth s resources .
added to this are the resourcehungry activities of industrial from the crop need for irrigation water synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging transport now a major part of global trade and retail .
consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy .
analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation .
the ideas of embodied resource use the total resources needed to produce a product or service resource intensity and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption .
key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy materials and waterin the international resource panel hosted by the united nations environment programme unep published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries .
the study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health human health and resource depletion .
by humanity could consume an estimated billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption .
developed countries citizens consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable .
to reduce waste industry business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by industrial metabolism into resource .
however the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare resources or profit margins .
the challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact .
this must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between on the one hand economic growth and on the other environmental damage and resource depletion .
there is concern that unless resource use is checked modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base .
while conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth fair distribution and efficient allocation in that order .
ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality .
in the international resource panel hosted by the united nations environment programme unep warned that by the human race could be devouring billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per times its current rate of nations can make serious attempts at decoupling .
the report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries .
sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity the amount of resource eg .
on the one hand it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity ie energy and materials use per unit gdp could in principle be reduced by at least four or fivefold thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution .
on the other hand an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth in large part because of the rebound effect conservation or jevons paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution .
since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution ie economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run .
participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources .
for example industrial waste can be treated as an economic resource in the wrong place .
laszlo and zhexembayeva s research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation a better riskmanagement b increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use c better product differentiation d new market entrances e enhanced brand and reputation f greater opportunity to influence industry standards and g greater opportunity for radical innovation .
nadya zhexembayeva s research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services as well as the company strategy as a whole when right principles of innovation are applied .
attempts made by businesses to greenwash their practices are regarded as false advertising and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology such as walmart s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption viz .
social disruptions like war crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future and generally threaten human wellbeing and the environment .
depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of resource wars .
this aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere .
bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships if unchecked have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited .
resources are also available for verifying the lifecycle of products and the producer or vendor level such as green seal for cleaning products for carpet production and even labeling of organic food in the united states .

it also acknowledges that human civilisation takes resources to sustain our modern way of life .
sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us protecting it from damage and destructionwe now live in a modern consumerist and largely urban existence throughout the developed world and we consume a lot of natural resources every day .
that s not to say that sustainable living should only focus on people who live in urban centres though there are improvements to be made everywhere it is estimated that we use about more resources every year than we can put back and that needs to change .
the supply and demand market is consumerist in nature and modern life requires a lot of resources every single day for the sake of the environment getting what we consume under control is the paramount issue .
it is also about maintaining access to basic resources without compromising the quality of life .
it defines how we should study and protect ecosystems air quality integrity and sustainability of our resources and focusing on the elements that place stress on the environment .
the sdg eventually came up with a list of items which included amongst other things finally it acknowledged the concept of nature having certain rights that people have stewardship of the world and the importance of putting people at the forefront of solving the above global issues through management of the environment and of consumption for example reducing packaging and discouraging food waste as well as promoting the use of recyclable materials humans have since the neolithic agricultural revolution and maybe even before then been a consumer rather than a replenisher of environmental resources .
from huntergatherer societies that moved into an area to use up its resources in a season before setting up camp or moving on only to return the following year to do the same the development of a surplus economy saw permanent settlements .
cultural change often led to survival of those societies beyond what might have been expected under the circumstances though some renaissance and enlightenment philosophers would express concern about resources and overpopulation and whether these were sustainable in the long term these people were not taken seriously at the time other than as a hypothetical question .
we knew by the about the problems of the greenhouse effect and the destruction of the ozone layer and coming very late in the century an awareness of the notion that some of our resources particularly fossil fuels were finite and that we should make efforts to move to renewable methods of power .
since the we have experienced unprecedented growth including intensive farming a technological revolution and a massive increase in our power needs putting even greater pressure and strain on the planet s resources .

in the human development paradigm environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and in the end wellbeing .
in addition resources like the global reporting initiative and business and human rights resource centre all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability .
priority has been given to economic and environmental sustainability in particular in the context of urban planning and housing where policy and investment has focused on renewable resources low carbon communities and encouraging proenvironmental household behaviours .
as a result there are few practical resources that directly address the question of how to create places that are socially sustainable as well as physical infrastructure that is environmentally sustainable .

in the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability including measures of resource use like life cycle assessment measures of consumption like the ecological footprint and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the environmental performance index .
it would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level onlypart of this process can relate to resource use such as energy accounting or to economic metrics or price system values as compared to nonmarket economics potential for understanding resource use .
an important task for resource theory energy economics is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes .
human factors however have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the industrial revolution and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality .
this happens long before the resource is physically exhaustednote that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil which is a measure of oil and a barrel of oil equivalent boe which is a measure of energy .
coal resources and future production pdf published on april by the energy watch group ewg which reports to the german parliament found that global coal production could peak in as few as years .
phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanolhubbert s original analysis did not apply to renewable resources .
a modified hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced .
this turns much of the world s underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil .
these debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive .

sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends .
the desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system .
the modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature .
it has been argued weasel words that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth s finite stock .
citation needed sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity or human replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems .
there is an additional focus on the present generations responsibility to regenerate maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations .
in response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in england john evelyn argued that sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive overexploitation of natural resources in his essay sylva .
this in turn influenced people like gifford pinchot first head of the us forest service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the .
kenneth e boulding in his influential essay the economics of the coming spaceship earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources .
since natural resources are derived from the environment the state of air water and the climate are of particular concern .
citation needed an unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital the sum total of nature s resources is used up faster than it can be replenished .
sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally .
pollution of the public resources is really not a different action it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons in that instead of taking something out something is put into the commons .
so this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal usesustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems .
the concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted .
organizations it has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets called natural capital .
sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption .
in the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource .
this is a resource to be protected .
one common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a costbenefit analysis .
this type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited .
this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd under the following definition ecoefficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the lifecycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity desimone and popoff .
sustainability as in effects towards human resources environment and ecology has to be measured within each department of the company .
the framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable developmentthe united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance .
the most common critiques are related to issues like data quality comparability objective function and the necessary resources .
furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources .
the goals presented by leed design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality .
while it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace ecosystem services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the amazonian forest .
a further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multifunctionality of many natural resources .
they postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a business as usual mentality .
this vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education an empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony .
in effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developersbut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of nonrenewable resources like minerals .
thus environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall sustainable development in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources it makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates .
when the discussion switched to global ecological limits to growth the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency or what was termed a change in the quality of growth .
however most countries in the west had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the century already and as usual only this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report .
the resettlement project of vila chocolatão commenced in in response to an imminent eviction of the community with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of porto alegre s renown participatory budgeting system .
the project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site residencial nova chocolatão linked to the garbagecollection process of the city an example of linking the subdomains of emission and waste and organization and governance and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community .
in each of these domains there are subdomainsthe economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production use and management of resources where the concept of resources is used in the broadest sense of that wordthe ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature but also including the builtenvironmentthe political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power such as organization authorization legitimation and regulation .

bateson had tried to bridge the natureculture divide the majority of studies focused on investigating processes within the social domain only treating the ecosystem largely as a black box and assuming that if the social system performs adaptively or is well organised institutionally it will also manage the environmental resource base in a sustainable fashion .
elinor ostrom and her many coresearchers have developed a comprehensive socialecological systems ses framework within which much of the stillevolving theory of commonpool resources and collective selfgovernance is now located .
it is thus the communities which interact with ecosystems on the daily basis and over long periods of time that possess the most relevant knowledge of resource and ecosystem dynamics together with associated management practices .
its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and where possible to repair damage and reverse trends due to the pressures of overconsumption population growth and technology the biophysical environment is being degraded sometimes permanently .
an ecosystems approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges .
many of the earth s resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across many countries .
as a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources .
in china was ranked out of countries on the environmental performance indexchina has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation rapid growth in gdp has been china s main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high gdp .
there is an authorized state body the federal ministry of natural resources and ecology .
it established the administrative organization of the secretariat for the improvement of the environment subsecretaría para el mejoramiento del ambiente in the department of health and welfarethe secretariat of environment and natural resources secretaría del medio ambiente y recursos naturales semarnat is mexico s environment ministry .
environmental resource management is the management of the interaction and impact of human societies on the environment .
environmental resources management aims to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and maintained for future human generations and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering ethical economic and scientific ecological variables .
environmental resource management tries to identify factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting resources .
it is thus linked to environmental protection sustainability and integrated landscape managementenvironmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global sociopolitical frameworks such as the brundtland commission s our common future which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and international development and the worldwatch institute s annual state of the world reportsthe environment determines the nature of people animals plants and places around the earth affecting behaviour religion culture and economic practicesenvironmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives .
the essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical economical social and technological .
these underlie principles and help make decisionsthe concept of environmental determinism probabilism and possibilism are significant in the concept of environmental resource managementenvironmental resource management covers many areas in science including geography biology social sciences political sciences public policy ecology physics chemistry sociology psychology and physiologyenvironmental resource management strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of humannature relationships .
broadly speaking two schools of thought exist in environmental ethics anthropocentrism and ecocentrism each influencing a broad spectrum of environmental resource management styles along a continuum .
anthropocentric environmental resource management is therefore not the conservation of the environment solely for the environment s sake but rather the conservation of the environment and ecosystem structure for humans sakeecocentrists believe in the intrinsic value of nature while maintaining that human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live .
debate continues among economists as to how to account for natural capital specifically whether resources can be replaced through knowledge and technology or whether the environment is a closed system that can not be replenished and is finite .
economic models influence environmental resource management in that management policies reflect beliefs about natural capital scarcity .
for example economic paradigms based on neoclassical models of closed economic systems are primarily concerned with resource scarcity and thus prescribe legalizing the environment as an economic externality for an environmental resource management strategy .
the pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for nearterm action constitutes a difficult reality and a common lament for many environmental resource managers .
a common scientific concept and impetus behind environmental resource management is carrying capacity .
simply put carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of organisms a particular resource can sustain .
however it is argued that western scientific knowledge is often insufficient to deal with the full complexity of the interplay of variables in environmental resource management .
these concerns have been recently addressed by a shift in environmental resource management approaches to incorporate different knowledge systems including traditional knowledge reflected in approaches such as adaptive comanagement communitybased natural resource management and transitions management .
sustainability in environmental resource management involves managing economic social and ecological systems both within and outside an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in .
in context sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on a finite planet development improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources .
sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stakeholders .
the end result should be a symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization community and environmentmany drivers compel environmental resource management to take sustainability issues into account .
as an exceptionally powerful contributing factor to social and environmental change the modern organisation has the potential to apply environmental resource management with sustainability principals to achieve highly effective outcomes .
to achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management an organisation should work within sustainability principles including social and environmental accountability longterm planning a strong shared vision a holistic focus devolved and consensus decision making broad stakeholder engagement and justice transparency measures trust and flexibility .
some of the world s largest and most profitable corporations are shifting to sustainable environmental resource management ford toyota bmw honda shell du port sta toil swiss re hewlettpackard and unilever among others .
it is important to note that though sustainability of environmental resource management has improved corporate sustainability for one has yet to reach the majority of global companies operating in the markets .
the three major barriers to preventing organizations to shift towards sustainable practice with environmental resource management are not understanding what sustainability is having difficulty modeling an economically viable case for the switch and having a flawed execution plan or a lack thereof .
therefore the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization and to clarify the business case .
in environmental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering natural resource management and implementing environmental protection legislation .
the traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgement through skilled technicians on behalf of the public .
with the increase of intractable environmental problems the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environmental resources .
this has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors including other governments private and civil to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours .
the private sector s traditional role in environmental resource management is that of the recovery of natural resources .
environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type that being renewable or nonrenewable and private and common resources also see tragedy of the commons .
functioning through strong public pressure civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource management plans particularly land management plans .
the aim of civil society in environmental resource management is to be included in the decisionmaking process by means of public participation .
public participation can be an effective strategy to invoke a sense of social responsibility of natural resources .
by eliminating the unsaleables from the comprehensive outcome of any purchase better environmental resource management is achieved without systemsrecent successful cases have put forward the notion of integrated management .
