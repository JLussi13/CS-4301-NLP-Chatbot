ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems .
ecological economist herman daly asked what use is a sawmill without a forest .
this suggested a more complex figure of sustainability which included the importance of the domain of politicsmore than that sustainability implies responsible and proactive decisionmaking and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience economic prosperity political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future .
specific types of sustainability include sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture or ecological economics .
more recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the circles of sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability this in accord with the united nations unesco agenda and in particular the agenda for culture which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development .
rather it involves treating all four ecology politics and social including economics and distinguishing between ecology as the intersection of the human and natural worlds and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know .
resiliency in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability .
resiliencethinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service s current and future generations need from them .
it is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life .
the history of sustainability traces humandominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present day .
there is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought including cradletocradle laws of ecology looped and performance economy regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and the blue economy .
the ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen .
the resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways embedded in the goods and services of world trade taken from the past eg .
by over exploiting forests and fisheries the figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their ecological footprint with their un human development index a measure of standard of living .
romanian american economist nicholas georgescuroegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of earth that is earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use .

a recent unep report proposes a green economy defined as one that improves human wellbeing and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital .
the report makes three key findings that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of gdp growth that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs .
while conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth fair distribution and efficient allocation in that order .
ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality .
consequently longterm sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total gdp remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by herman daly and others in the ecological economics communitya different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach .
sustainable business practices on the other hand integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones ie the triple bottom line .
one school of thought often labeled ecosocialism or ecological marxism asserts that the capitalist economic system is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability .
this theory rests on the premises that thus according to this analysis by this logic marketbased solutions to ecological crises ecological economics environmental economics green economy are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism s structural failures .
they also note that up until the event of total ecological collapse destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation thus capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters ie .
ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by egalitarian economicpoliticalsocial structure designed to harmonize human society with nonhuman ecology and to fulfill human the only sufficient solution to the presentday ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability .
social ecology founded by bookchin is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity s present ecological problems originate in indeed are mere symptoms of dysfunctional social arrangements .
whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems implementing recommendations which stem from physical biological economic etc studies bookchin s claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences .
for the government one cost might be the loss of public confidence and trust while a firm might lose market share and profitability deep ecology is a movement founded by arne naess that establishes principles for the wellbeing of all life on earth and the richness and diversity of life forms .
in short sustainability looks to protect our natural environment human and ecological health while driving innovation and not compromising our way of life .

the pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for nearterm action constitutes a difficult reality and a common lament for many environmental resource managers .
scientific analysis of the environment deals with several dimensions of ecological uncertainty .
these include structural uncertainty resulting from the misidentification or lack of information pertaining to the relationships between ecological variables parameter uncertainty referring to uncertainty associated with parameter values that are not known precisely but can be assessed and reported in terms of the experiencing a defined range of outcomes and stochastic uncertainty stemming from chance or unrelated factors .
