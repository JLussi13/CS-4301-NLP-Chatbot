information is gained from green computing green chemistry earth science environmental science and conservation biology .
ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions eg ecovillages ecomunicipalities and sustainable cities reappraising economic sectors permaculture green building sustainable agriculture or work practices sustainable architecture using science to develop new technologies green technologies renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources .
it aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable .
greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue harvestable and green soil water available for plant use water and this applies at all scales of water management .
at the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities .
a recent unep report proposes a green economy defined as one that improves human wellbeing and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital .
the report makes three key findings that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of gdp growth that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs .
green economics is another marketbased attempt to address issues of equity and the environment .
research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability and led to emergence of the concept of embedded sustainability by its authors chris laszlo and nadya zhexembayeva as incorporation of environmental health and social value into the core business with no tradeoff in price or other words with no social or green premium .
this theory rests on the premises that thus according to this analysis by this logic marketbased solutions to ecological crises ecological economics environmental economics green economy are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism s structural failures .
resources are also available for verifying the lifecycle of products and the producer or vendor level such as green seal for cleaning products for carpet production and even labeling of organic food in the united states .
