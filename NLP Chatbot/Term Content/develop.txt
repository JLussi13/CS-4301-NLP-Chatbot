sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced fashion in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations .
subdomains of sustainable development have been considered also cultural technological and political .
while sustainable development may be the organizing principle for sustainability for some for others the two terms are paradoxical ie .
development is inherently unsustainable .
sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
brundtland report for the world commission on environment and development introduced the term of sustainable developmentsustainability can also be defined as a socioecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal .
ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions eg ecovillages ecomunicipalities and sustainable cities reappraising economic sectors permaculture green building sustainable agriculture or work practices sustainable architecture using science to develop new technologies green technologies renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources .
the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
since the sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development that of the brundtland commission of the united nations on march sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
the world summit on social development identified sustainable development goals such as economic development social development and environmental protection .
sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment .
the question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environmenta study from pointed out that environmental justice is as important as sustainable development .
understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like liberty or justice .
it has also been described as a dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development .
while the united nations millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains economics environment and social sustainability .
more recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the circles of sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability this in accord with the united nations unesco agenda and in particular the agenda for culture which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development .
one of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the and is called the i pat formula .
most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from billion in to billion in .
this increase will be distributed among the population aged billion and or over billion because the number of children under age in developing countries is predicted to decrease .
in contrast the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from billion to billion and this would have declined to billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries which is expected to average million persons annually from to .
it is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability .
by over exploiting forests and fisheries the figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their ecological footprint with their un human development index a measure of standard of living .
this is most clearly demonstrated through use of contextbased sustainability cbs tools methods and metrics including the multicapital scorecard which have been in development since .
the sustainable development goals sdgs are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targetsthe official agenda for sustainable development adopted on september has paragraphs with the main paragraph outlining the sustainable development goals and its associated targets .
the sustainable development goals sdgs replace the eight millennium development goals mdgs which expired at the end of .
adopted by the united nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by to the data that member countries represented to the united nations cuba was the only country in the world in that met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development with an ecological footprint of less than hectares per capita and a human development index of over .
herman daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for nonrenewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment .
ten per cent of the world s million in lowlying areas vulnerable to sea level riseloss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to manmade capital .
key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy materials and waterin the international resource panel hosted by the united nations environment programme unep published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries .
reduction of current levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energyintensive high consumption western lifestyles .
reducing greenhouse emissions is being tackled at all scales ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the carbon cycle to the commercialization of renewable energy developing less carbonhungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use .
this rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the the increase in irrigated land growth in industrial and power sectors and intensive dam construction on all continents .
a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible .
concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the obesity problems of the western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism .
developed countries citizens consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable .
at present the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to highconsumption western lifestyles .
the developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable .
the challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact .
the world business council for sustainable development states that business can not succeed in societies that fail .
the report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries .
energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing coststhe idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the sustainability consortium of the society for organizational learning the sustainable business institute and the world council for sustainable development .
the relationship between human rights and human development corporate power and environmental justice global poverty and citizen action suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice .
broadbased strategies for more sustainable social systems include improved education and the political empowerment of women especially in developing countries greater regard for social justice notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries and intergenerational equity .
such acknowledgment has been made by the brundtland commission report our common future and the millennium development goals .
there is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues according to the brundtland report poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems .
the word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment .
another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as bridges to prosperity s use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in asia and africaaccording to murray bookchin the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies .
the concept of a billionyear sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species for example through artificial photosynthesis allowing rights of nature .
in sustainable architecture the recent movement of new classical architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design .
the united nations has recognised the central role of education and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development which aims to challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future .
important in the advancement of this notion have been the united nations unesco and in particular their agenda and agenda for culture now also known as culture a program for cultural governance developed in and coordinated by united cities and local governments uclg created in is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism .
to encourage progress epa developed a strategic approach to incorporate sustainability principles into its work .

by administrator lisa p jacksonthis week i join colleagues from across the us and around the world at the un conference on sustainable development .
on the anniversary of the un earth summit that set an early course for sustainability across the globe we are working to shape the next years of sustainable development with the help of governments businesses students nonprofits and global citizensour work will be focused on new strategies to reinvest in the health and prosperity of urban communities .
we re taking this opportunity at to develop strategies for both improving existing infrastructure and building new efficient cuttingedge systems .
the core skills with which a graduates leaves college or university are highly sought after especially in a modern world looking to drastically reduce carbon emissions and discover and develop the technologies of the future .
sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us protecting it from damage and destructionwe now live in a modern consumerist and largely urban existence throughout the developed world and we consume a lot of natural resources every day .
sustainability and sustainable development focuses on balancing that fine line between competing needs our need to move forward technologically and economically and the needs to protect the environments in which we and others live .
sustainability is not just about the environment it s also about our health as a society in ensuring that no people or areas of life suffer as a result of environmental legislation and it s also about examining the longer term effects of the actions humanity takes and asking questions about how it may be improved in the world summit on social development identified three core areas that contribute to the philosophy and social science of sustainable development .
the brundtland commission described it as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
economic development is about giving people what they want without compromising quality of life especially in the developing world and reducing the financial burden and red tape of doing the right thingthere are many facets to this pillar .
in north america europe and the rest of the developed world there are strong checks and programmes of legislation in place to ensure that people s health and wellness is strongly protected .
it also concerns how technology will drive our greener future the epa recognized that developing technology and biotechnology is key to this sustainability and protecting the environment of the future from potential damage that technological advances could potentially bring the sustainable development professional network thinks acts and works globally .
in the united nations conference on sustainable development met to discuss and develop a set of goals to work towards they grew out of the millennium development goals mdg that claimed success in reducing global poverty while acknowledging there was still much more to do .
from huntergatherer societies that moved into an area to use up its resources in a season before setting up camp or moving on only to return the following year to do the same the development of a surplus economy saw permanent settlements .
today their remit is to contribute to the building of peace the eradication of poverty sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education the sciences culture communication and information by the late century the science of climate change was firmly established .
we are also far more aware of the plight of the developing world and that facing our planet as we now observe both natural and humancaused disasters and the effects that these can have on the ecosystems and on human population .
it s vital that we develop new cleaner technologies to cope with our energy demands but sustainability is not just about the environmentthe biggest social activism movement related to the social development side of sustainability has been programs such as fair trade and the rainforest alliance in encouraging good farming practices while ensuring farmers who produce luxury goods such as coffee and cocoa receive a decent living wage .

the idea of sustainability stems from the concept of sustainable development which became common language at the world s first earth summit in rio in .
the original definition of sustainable development is usually considered to be development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
bruntland report for the world commission on environment and development since then there have been many variations and extensions on this basic definition .
many argue that sustainability has been hijacked and twisted to suit government and business that really want to continue with business as usualthe quotes below will provide some ideas on what constitutes sustainable development and sustainability .
a process of change in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations the world commission on environment and development sustainable development is a dynamic process which enables people to realise their potential and improve their quality of life in ways which simultaneously protect and enhance the earth s life support systems forum for the future in essence sustainable development is about five key principles quality of life fairness and equity participation and partnership care for our environment and respect for ecological constraints recognising there are environmental limits and thought for the future and the precautionary principle .
the real world coalition a definition based on the work of the world commission on environment and development we can not just add sustainable development to our current list of things to do but must learn to integrate the concepts into everything that we do .
the shaky ground of sustainable development donald worster in global ecology what do you believe are the most pressing questions priorities and challenges to the creation of a sustainable society both locally and globally .
un decade of education for sustainable development the overall goal of the un decade of education for sustainable development desd is to integrate the principles values and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning .
social life is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching sustainability and sustainable development .
the concept of social sustainability in this approach encompasses such topics as social equity livability health equity community development social capital social support human rights labour rights placemaking social responsibility social justice cultural competence community resilience and human adaptationa second more recent approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social including ecological economic political and cultural sustainability .
another definition has been developed by social life a ukbased social enterprise specialising in placebased innovation .
social life have developed a framework for social sustainability which has four dimensions amenities and infrastructure social and cultural life voice and influence and space to grow .
nobel laureate amartya sen gives the following dimensions for social sustainability also we can speak of sustainable human development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations .
in the human development paradigm environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and in the end wellbeing .
a useful tool that assists companies in developing such disclosures is the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights reporting framework .
international principles guidelines tools and global initiatives related to business and human rightsthe following table builds upon the resources provided in appendix a to the burma reporting requirements and will incorporate additional resources as they are developed .
for example instead of designating a pregiven set of indicators the approach sets out a process for deciding upon indicators and analysing the relationship between themthis is all developed in detail in a book that forms the basis of this website published by routledge called urban sustainability in theory and practice circles of sustainabilitythe circles approach provides tools for responding to four key questions .
the resulting profiles remain simple on the surface even as they encourage deep researchwhat possible practical pathways should we take in the process of developing a positive response to issues of sustainability resilience adaptability and liveability process circles guide practitioners through logical pathways for carrying out a project large or small .
one popular general framework used by the european environment agency uses a slight modification of the organisation for economic cooperation and development dpsir system .
social and economic developments consumption and production d rive or initiate environmental p ressures which in turn produces a change in the s tate of the environment which leads to i mpacts of various kinds .
societal r esponses policy guided by sustainability indicators can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of eventsthe united nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement tools in relation to sustainable development as well as a system of integrated environmental and economic accounting .
an important task for resource theory energy economics is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes .
human factors however have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the industrial revolution and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality .

sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends .
sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generationswhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the brundtland report it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns .
as the concept developed it has shifted to focus more on economic development social development and environmental protection for future generations .
it has been suggested that the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
the modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature .
instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good .
the economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called managed sustainable development msd the concept of sustainable development has still to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development .
sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity .
sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science .
development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the and centuries .
building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jeanbaptiste colbert von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield .
his work influenced others including alexander von humboldt and georg ludwig hartig eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry .
this in turn influenced people like gifford pinchot first head of the us forest service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the .
following the publication of rachel carson s silent spring in the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation .
following the club of rome report an mit research group prepared ten days of hearings on growth and its implication for the future roundtable press for the us congress the first hearings ever held on sustainable development .
citation needed in the international union for the conservation of nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term sustainable development .
in the united nations world commission on environment and development released the report our common future commonly called the brundtland report .
the report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development .
since the brundtland report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth .
in the un conference on environment and development published the earth charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the century .
the action plan agenda for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars .
it emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information .
it stresses the need to change from old sectorcentered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve crosssectoral coordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes .
furthermore agenda emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development .
under the principles of the united nations charter the millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection .
broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations .
the term sustainable development as used by the united nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education public health and standard of living .
in september the united nations general assembly formally adopted the universal integrated and transformative agenda for sustainable development a set of sustainable development goals sdgs .
the goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year to development or sustainability has been described in terms of three spheres dimensions domains or pillars ie .
also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health .
fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species .
inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity .
citation needed integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities .
a telling example is the european environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development .
a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible .
because left unaddressed the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way .
economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product .
sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption .
issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of longterm outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation .
scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a steadystate economy to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet .
in the economist edward barbier published the study the concept of sustainable economic development where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other .
the study interpreting sustainability in economic terms found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage intergenerational equity and dynamic efficiency .
but gilbert rist points out that the world bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem .
he writes from this angle sustainable development looks like a coverup operation .
the thing that is meant to be sustained is really development not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies .
herman daly an economist for the bank from to writes when authors of wdr the highly influential world development report that featured the environment were drafting the report they called me asking for examples of winwin strategies in my work .
it has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics .
they enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment .
misum is a crossdisciplinary and multistakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms sustainability in financial markets mistra financial systems sustainability in production and consumption and sustainable socioeconomic development .
benefitcost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place .
overall and in the long run sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies .
main article green manufacturing and distributed manufacturingone of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs .
technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology which is an ideological movement and its manifestations originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist e f schumacher in his influential work small is beautiful .
today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to opensource appropriate technology osat and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the internet .
osat has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development .
sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development .
according to a series of reports by the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp sustainable transport can help create jobs improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient .
this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd under the following definition ecoefficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the lifecycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity desimone and popoff .
however as dyllick and hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development .
they point towards ecoeffectiveness socioeffectiveness sufficiency and ecoequity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached .

in sustainable architecture the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design .
citation needed a study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policymaking .
the international institute for sustainable development has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics .
the framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable developmentthe united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance .
they have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics this accords with the brundtland commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triplebottomline dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society .
in this context the agenda for culture and the united cities and local governments uclg executive bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement culture fourth pillar of sustainable development passed on november in the framework of the world summit of local and regional leaders world congress of uclg held in mexico city .
this document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies .
other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development .
the network of excellence sustainable development in a diverse world sponsored by the european union integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development .
the fourth pillar of sustainable development theory has been referenced by executive director of imi institute at unesco vito di bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement neofuturism whose name was inspired by the united nations report our common future .
the united nations conference on sustainable development uncsd also known as rio was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community .
an outcome of this conference was the development of the sustainable development goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world .
however few nations met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development criteria established in .
although some nations are more developed than others all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms .
however a more general criticism is coming from the project management community how can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we can not monitor it in any single project .
furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources .
although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building .
the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be nonsubstitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible .
citation needed main page education for sustainable developmenteducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable .
this vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education an empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony .
when nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives a quiet revolution is set in motion education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering finance supply chain and operations is gaining weightage .
referencehttps wwwwhartonupenneduhttp wwwcolumbiaeduhttp casiglobalusit has been argued that since the the concept of sustainable development has changed from conservation management to economic development whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat .
in the however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries and not just in africa .
this was a strategy of economic development and the strategy was carried even further by the brundtland commission s report on our common future when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application .
in effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developersbut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of nonrenewable resources like minerals .
thus environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall sustainable development in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources it makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates .
one critic has argued that the brundtland commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of sustainable development attached as a public relations slogan the report on our common future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders .
after world war ii the notion of development had been established in the west to imply the projection of the american model of society onto the rest of the world .
since the publication of the report the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of sustainable development has marched on worldwide .

elinor ostrom and her many coresearchers have developed a comprehensive socialecological systems ses framework within which much of the stillevolving theory of commonpool resources and collective selfgovernance is now located .
being a relatively new concept ses theory has emerged from a combination of disciplinary platforms and the notion of complexity developed through the work of many scholars notably the santa fe institute .
sess are both complex and adaptive meaning that they require continuous testing learning about and developing knowledge and understanding in order to cope with change and uncertainty .
it generates path dependency which refers to local rules of interaction that change as the system evolves and develops .
a consequence of path dependency is the existence of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystem development and the potential for threshold behaviour and qualitative shifts in system dynamics under changing environmental influences .
there are several conceptual frameworks developed in relation to the resilience approachberkes and colleagues distinguish four sets of elements which can be used to describe socialecological system characteristics and linkages knowledge acquisition of sess is an ongoing dynamic learning process and such knowledge often emerges with people s institutions and organisations .
in terms of its dynamics the adaptive cycle has been described as moving slowly from exploitation r to conservation k maintaining and developing very rapidly from k to release w continuing rapidly to reorganisation a and back to exploitation r .
the concept of socialecological systems has been developed in order to provide both a promising scientific gain as well as impact on problems of sustainable development .
problems of sustainable development are intrinsically tied to the socialecological system defined to tackle them .
there is no agreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity and even scientific dishonesty occurs so protection measures are occasionally debatedin industrial countries voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of best environmental practice .
ca gajendra kumar jain a chartered accountant is the founder of environment improvement trust in sojat city a small village of state of rajasthan in india in developing countries such as latin america these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of noncompliance with mandatory regulation .
the key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity .
this approach ideally supports a better exchange of information development of conflictresolution strategies and improved regional conservation .
as a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources .
since there has been a more broadreaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the national environment management council nemc and the development of an environmental act .
the nemc the following purposes provide technical advice coordinate technical activities develop enforcement guidelines and procedures assess monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment promote and assist environmental information and communication and seek advancement of scientific knowledge .
the policy objectives are to achieve the following use ecofriendly resourcestanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the rio declaration on development and environment and the convention on biological diversity .
china was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy .
in china was ranked out of countries on the environmental performance indexchina has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation rapid growth in gdp has been china s main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high gdp .
for china to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies .
quote from shengxian zhou head of mep good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure production form and develop model .
this includes nonpoint source or diffuse pollution such as sediment pollution from construction sitesaustralia ranks second place on the un human development index and one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios of the developed economies .
the international organization for standardization has developed iso and iso to establish principles and procedures for environmental labels and declarations that certifiers and ecolabellers should follow .
it is thus linked to environmental protection sustainability and integrated landscape managementenvironmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global sociopolitical frameworks such as the brundtland commission s our common future which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and international development and the worldwatch institute s annual state of the world reportsthe environment determines the nature of people animals plants and places around the earth affecting behaviour religion culture and economic practicesenvironmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives .
colby has identified trends in the development of economic paradigms among them a shift towards more ecological economics since the .
in context sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on a finite planet development improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources .
to achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management an organisation should work within sustainability principles including social and environmental accountability longterm planning a strong shared vision a holistic focus devolved and consensus decision making broad stakeholder engagement and justice transparency measures trust and flexibility .
