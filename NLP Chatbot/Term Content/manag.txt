ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentallyfriendly chemical engineering environmental resources management and environmental protection .
resiliencethinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between humanconstructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive .
it is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life .
sustainability is studied and managed over many scales levels or frames of reference of time and space and in many contexts of environmental social and economic organization .
careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services .
sustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability .
there are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management .
this direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science environmental science and conservation biologyhowever this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption so a second approach is through demand management of human resource usemanagement of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics .
at the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans freshwater systems land and atmosphere but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden .
management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address humaninduced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities see energy below other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer .
due to the water cycle fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource .
greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue harvestable and green soil water available for plant use water and this applies at all scales of water management .
consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy .
water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased demand management improved infrastructure improved water productivity of agriculture minimising the water intensity embodied water of goods and services addressing shortages in the nonindustrialized world concentrating food production in areas of high productivity and planning for climate change such as through flexible system design .
international legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods .
the european union is expected to table by the end of an ambitious circular economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management ecodesign and limits on land fillson one account sustainability concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons .
the challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact .
water energy or materials needed for the production consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service whether this be achieved from improved economic management product design or new technology .
this aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere .
the concept of circular flow land use management has also been introduced in europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawllarge scale social movements can influence both community choices and the built environment .

the sdg eventually came up with a list of items which included amongst other things finally it acknowledged the concept of nature having certain rights that people have stewardship of the world and the importance of putting people at the forefront of solving the above global issues through management of the environment and of consumption for example reducing packaging and discouraging food waste as well as promoting the use of recyclable materials humans have since the neolithic agricultural revolution and maybe even before then been a consumer rather than a replenisher of environmental resources .

sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generationswhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the brundtland report it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns .
the economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called managed sustainable development msd the concept of sustainable development has still to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development .
development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the and centuries .
building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jeanbaptiste colbert von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield .
this in turn influenced people like gifford pinchot first head of the us forest service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the .
broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations .
so this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal usesustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems .
i wanted to contribute because wdrs are important in the bank because task managers read them to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects .
the framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable developmentthe united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance .
however a more general criticism is coming from the project management community how can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we can not monitor it in any single project .
the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be nonsubstitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible .
referencehttps wwwwhartonupenneduhttp wwwcolumbiaeduhttp casiglobalusit has been argued that since the the concept of sustainable development has changed from conservation management to economic development whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat .
this was a strategy of conservation management .
in effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developersbut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of nonrenewable resources like minerals .
circles of sustainability is a method for understanding and assessing sustainability and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes .
it is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles eg hyderabad johannesburg melbourne new delhi são paulo and tehran .
in particular some of the innovating cities in the programme have influenced the development of the circles of sustainability method through their management of major projects some with intensity and others as a background feature .
the methodology was first used by metropolis for commission managing urban growth .
this commission which met across the period was asked to make recommendations for use by metropolis s member cities on the theme of managing growth .
in each of these domains there are subdomainsthe economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production use and management of resources where the concept of resources is used in the broadest sense of that wordthe ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature but also including the builtenvironmentthe political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power such as organization authorization legitimation and regulation .

bateson had tried to bridge the natureculture divide the majority of studies focused on investigating processes within the social domain only treating the ecosystem largely as a black box and assuming that if the social system performs adaptively or is well organised institutionally it will also manage the environmental resource base in a sustainable fashion .
management processes in the complex systems can be improved by making them adaptive and flexible able to deal with uncertainty and surprise and by building capacity to adapt to change .
therefore complex systems should always be analysed or managed simultaneously at different scalesself organisation is one of the defining properties of complex systems .
it is thus the communities which interact with ecosystems on the daily basis and over long periods of time that possess the most relevant knowledge of resource and ecosystem dynamics together with associated management practices .
some scholars have suggested that management and governance of sess may benefit from combination of different knowledge systems others have attempted to import such knowledge into the scientific knowledge field there also those who have argued that it would be difficult to separate these knowledge systems from their institutional and cultural contexts and those who have questioned the role of traditional and local knowledge systems in the current situation of pervasive environmental change and globalised societies .
other scholars have claimed that valuable lessons can be extracted from such systems for complex system management lessons that also need to account for interactions across temporal and spatial scales and organisational and institutional levels and in particular during periods of rapid change uncertainty and system reorganisation .
here a few feedbacks between the ecological system and the social system exist and the ses is unable to innovate and adapt the αphase of reorganisation and growth in contrast different stakeholders have formed an adaptive management workgroup in the case of grand canyon using planned management interventions and monitoring to learn about changes occurring in the ecosystem including the best ways to subsequently manage them .
such an approach to institutional learning is becoming more common as ngos scientist and communities collaborate to manage ecosystems .
the key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity .
an ecosystems approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges .
as a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources .
since there has been a more broadreaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the national environment management council nemc and the development of an environmental act .
it does this through the formulation of policy coordinating and monitoring environmental issues environmental planning and policyoriented environmental researchthe national environment management council nemc is an institution that was initiated when the national environment management act was first introduced in year .
the environmental management act is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmentalmanagement decisions .
the act covers eight main areas there are several commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners such as kakadu national park extraordinary biodiversity such as christmas island national park or managed cooperatively due to crossstate location such as the australian alps national parks and reserves .
their jurisdiction is similar and covers pointsource pollution such as from industry or commercial activities landwater use and waste management .
most protected lands are managed by states and territories with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness national land and marine parks state forests and conservation areas .
emas is another eu label that signifies whether an organization management is green as opposed to the product .
environmental resource management is the management of the interaction and impact of human societies on the environment .
it is not as the phrase might suggest the management of the environment itself .
environmental resources management aims to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and maintained for future human generations and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering ethical economic and scientific ecological variables .
environmental resource management tries to identify factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting resources .
it is thus linked to environmental protection sustainability and integrated landscape managementenvironmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern as reflected in its prevalence in seminal texts influencing global sociopolitical frameworks such as the brundtland commission s our common future which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and international development and the worldwatch institute s annual state of the world reportsthe environment determines the nature of people animals plants and places around the earth affecting behaviour religion culture and economic practicesenvironmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives .
it involves the management of all components of the biophysical environment both living biotic and nonliving abiotic and the relationships among all living species and their habitats .
the essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical economical social and technological .
these underlie principles and help make decisionsthe concept of environmental determinism probabilism and possibilism are significant in the concept of environmental resource managementenvironmental resource management covers many areas in science including geography biology social sciences political sciences public policy ecology physics chemistry sociology psychology and physiologyenvironmental resource management strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of humannature relationships .
broadly speaking two schools of thought exist in environmental ethics anthropocentrism and ecocentrism each influencing a broad spectrum of environmental resource management styles along a continuum .
anthropocentric environmental resource management is therefore not the conservation of the environment solely for the environment s sake but rather the conservation of the environment and ecosystem structure for humans sakeecocentrists believe in the intrinsic value of nature while maintaining that human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live .
economic models influence environmental resource management in that management policies reflect beliefs about natural capital scarcity .
for someone who believes natural capital is infinite and easily substituted environmental management is irrelevant to the economy .
for example economic paradigms based on neoclassical models of closed economic systems are primarily concerned with resource scarcity and thus prescribe legalizing the environment as an economic externality for an environmental resource management strategy .
the pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for nearterm action constitutes a difficult reality and a common lament for many environmental resource managers .
adaptive management is considered a useful framework for dealing with situations of high levels of uncertainty though it is not without its detractors .
a common scientific concept and impetus behind environmental resource management is carrying capacity .
however it is argued that western scientific knowledge is often insufficient to deal with the full complexity of the interplay of variables in environmental resource management .
these concerns have been recently addressed by a shift in environmental resource management approaches to incorporate different knowledge systems including traditional knowledge reflected in approaches such as adaptive comanagement communitybased natural resource management and transitions management .
sustainability in environmental resource management involves managing economic social and ecological systems both within and outside an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in .
sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stakeholders .
the end result should be a symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization community and environmentmany drivers compel environmental resource management to take sustainability issues into account .
as an exceptionally powerful contributing factor to social and environmental change the modern organisation has the potential to apply environmental resource management with sustainability principals to achieve highly effective outcomes .
to achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management an organisation should work within sustainability principles including social and environmental accountability longterm planning a strong shared vision a holistic focus devolved and consensus decision making broad stakeholder engagement and justice transparency measures trust and flexibility .
some of the world s largest and most profitable corporations are shifting to sustainable environmental resource management ford toyota bmw honda shell du port sta toil swiss re hewlettpackard and unilever among others .
it is important to note that though sustainability of environmental resource management has improved corporate sustainability for one has yet to reach the majority of global companies operating in the markets .
the three major barriers to preventing organizations to shift towards sustainable practice with environmental resource management are not understanding what sustainability is having difficulty modeling an economically viable case for the switch and having a flawed execution plan or a lack thereof .
therefore the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization and to clarify the business case .
in environmental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering natural resource management and implementing environmental protection legislation .
the traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgement through skilled technicians on behalf of the public .
with the increase of intractable environmental problems the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environmental resources .
this has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors including other governments private and civil to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours .
the private sector s traditional role in environmental resource management is that of the recovery of natural resources .
environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type that being renewable or nonrenewable and private and common resources also see tragedy of the commons .
environmental managers from the private sector also need skills to manage collaboration within a dynamic social and political environment .
functioning through strong public pressure civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource management plans particularly land management plans .
the aim of civil society in environmental resource management is to be included in the decisionmaking process by means of public participation .
as with all management functions effective management tools standards and systems are required .
an environmental management standard or system or protocol attempts to reduce environmental impact as measured by some objective criteria .
the iso standard is the most widely used standard for environmental risk management and is closely aligned to the european ecomanagement and audit scheme emas .
as a common auditing standard the iso standard explains how to combine this with quality managementother environmental management systems ems tend to be based on the iso standard and many extend it in various ways other strategies exist that rely on making simple distinctions rather than building topdown management systems using performance audits and full cost accounting .
by eliminating the unsaleables from the comprehensive outcome of any purchase better environmental resource management is achieved without systemsrecent successful cases have put forward the notion of integrated management .
