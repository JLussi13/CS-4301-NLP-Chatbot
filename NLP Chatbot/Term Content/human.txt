sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced fashion in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations .
healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other organisms .
ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentallyfriendly chemical engineering environmental resources management and environmental protection .
ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems .
the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
despite the increased popularity of the use of the term sustainability the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been and continues to be light of environmental degradation climate change overconsumption population growth and societies pursuit of unlimited economic growth in a closed system .
since the sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development that of the brundtland commission of the united nations on march sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment .
from this perspective the economy is a subsystem of human society which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere and a gain in one sector is a loss from another .
this perspective led to the nested circles figure of economics inside society inside the environmentthe simple definition that sustainability is something that improves the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems though vague conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits .
the earth charter speaks of a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature universal human rights economic justice and a culture of peace .
rather it involves treating all four ecology politics and social including economics and distinguishing between ecology as the intersection of the human and natural worlds and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know .
another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities economy community occupational groups government environment culture and physiology .
from the global to the individual human scale each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels .
human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalitiesintegral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities .
resiliencethinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service s current and future generations need from them .
in this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced .
in analysing systems such as urban and national parks dams farms and gardens theme parks openpit mines water catchments one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a longterm vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events .
in early human history the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities .
the and energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on nonrenewable energy resourcesin the century there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human greenhouse effect produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels .
in short it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it .
for example he likens human existence on earth isolated as the planet is in space whereby people can not be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources can not be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water .
a major driver of human impact on earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources and especially the earth s ecosystems .
the environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved .
one of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the and is called the i pat formula .
this formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components population numbers levels of consumption which it terms affluence although the usage is different and impact per unit of resource use which is termed technology because this impact depends on the technology used .
at the global scale scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the carrying capacity of planet earth and that this can not continue indefinitely .
the ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen .
by over exploiting forests and fisheries the figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their ecological footprint with their un human development index a measure of standard of living .
romanian american economist nicholas georgescuroegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of earth that is earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use .
thus rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another cbs makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organizationspecific norms standards or thresholds for what they the impacts would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable ie which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or nonhuman wellbeing .
human impacts on the earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life most notably those of water oxygen carbon nitrogen and phosphorus .
it concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world ecosystems reducing both their resilience and biocapacity .
the report refers to natural systems as humanity s lifesupport system providing essential ecosystem services .
adopted by the united nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by to the data that member countries represented to the united nations cuba was the only country in the world in that met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development with an ecological footprint of less than hectares per capita and a human development index of over .
healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms .
there are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management .
this direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science environmental science and conservation biologyhowever this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption so a second approach is through demand management of human resource usemanagement of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics .
management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address humaninduced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities see energy below other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer .
ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and in turn the food supply of both humans and other organisms .
ten per cent of the world s million in lowlying areas vulnerable to sea level riseloss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to manmade capital .
land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation agriculture forest woodland grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems .
at the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities .
since the neolithic revolution about of the world s forests have been lost to human use .
feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the earth s resources .
the underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption .
key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy materials and waterin the international resource panel hosted by the united nations environment programme unep published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries .
the study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health human health and resource depletion .
in the decade human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade .
currently towards of human water use is unsustainable drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe populations increase aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary .
in the it was estimated that humans were using of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of for agriculture for industry and for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing .
further it is humane and just protecting farmers and other workers consumers and communities .
by humanity could consume an estimated billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption .
the effects of some chemical agents needed longterm measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health .
a recent unep report proposes a green economy defined as one that improves human wellbeing and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital .
this trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers economic growth and environmental indicators .
in the international resource panel hosted by the united nations environment programme unep warned that by the human race could be devouring billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per times its current rate of nations can make serious attempts at decoupling .
ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by egalitarian economicpoliticalsocial structure designed to harmonize human society with nonhuman ecology and to fulfill human the only sufficient solution to the presentday ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability .
sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists environmental activists and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in nature what every environmentalist needs to know is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom through social struggle in order to create a whole new coevolution with the planet .
the relationship between human rights and human development corporate power and environmental justice global poverty and citizen action suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice .
social disruptions like war crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future and generally threaten human wellbeing and the environment .
another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as bridges to prosperity s use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in asia and africaaccording to murray bookchin the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies .
nature is thus treated as a commodity the plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital .
social ecology founded by bookchin is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity s present ecological problems originate in indeed are mere symptoms of dysfunctional social arrangements .
the movement advocates among other things a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world .
the concept of a billionyear sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species for example through artificial photosynthesis allowing rights of nature .
but the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes at all levels and contexts of society .
application of social sustainability requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights prevention of human trafficking and other human rights risks .
to pursue sustainability is to create and maintain the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony to support present and future generationslearn more about sustainability and how epa incorporates it into its work in the national reseach council s report sustainability and the us epathe national environmental policy act of committed the united states to sustainability declaring it a national policy to create and maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony that permit fulfilling the social economic and other requirements of present and future generations in the years since nepa was enacted the public s interest in sustainability has broadened .
its design assists researchers and stakeholders in identifying specific indicators relevant to parts of the ecosystem such as air water energy human health risks and communities in general .
under development is a web tool that includes dosii the human wellbeing index and the environmental quality indexexecutive orders and governmentwide practices also influence epa s work .
sustainability is a broad discipline giving students and graduates insights into most aspects of the human world from business to technology to environment and the social sciences .
in short sustainability looks to protect our natural environment human and ecological health while driving innovation and not compromising our way of life .
it also acknowledges that human civilisation takes resources to sustain our modern way of life .
there are countless examples throughout human history where a civilisation has damaged its own environment and seriously affected its own survival chances some of which jared diamond explores in his book collapse how complex societies choose to fail or survive .
sustainability is not just about the environment it s also about our health as a society in ensuring that no people or areas of life suffer as a result of environmental legislation and it s also about examining the longer term effects of the actions humanity takes and asking questions about how it may be improved in the world summit on social development identified three core areas that contribute to the philosophy and social science of sustainable development .
environmental protection is the third pillar and to many the primary concern of the future of humanity .
the sdg eventually came up with a list of items which included amongst other things finally it acknowledged the concept of nature having certain rights that people have stewardship of the world and the importance of putting people at the forefront of solving the above global issues through management of the environment and of consumption for example reducing packaging and discouraging food waste as well as promoting the use of recyclable materials humans have since the neolithic agricultural revolution and maybe even before then been a consumer rather than a replenisher of environmental resources .
slash and burn farming replaced natural wilderness often with uniform crop plantation and camps gave way to settlements then eventually villages towns and cities which would put pressure on the environmentsometimes the environmental pressures forced people into making these changes in the first place growing human population being one of those pressures and often eventually they had to move on to somewhere new where the environmental could better sustain them and their practices or make further changes to their existing environment .
whether that was introducing alien species that upset the balance of the ecosystem cutting down too many trees at once or even a failure to adapt to natural fluctuations in the climate we are far more aware in the modern world about the potential damage caused by human action .
the united nations was founded after world war ii and in unesco was established to promote the importance of human culture and of science .
we are also far more aware of the plight of the developing world and that facing our planet as we now observe both natural and humancaused disasters and the effects that these can have on the ecosystems and on human population .
a process of change in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations the world commission on environment and development sustainable development is a dynamic process which enables people to realise their potential and improve their quality of life in ways which simultaneously protect and enhance the earth s life support systems forum for the future in essence sustainable development is about five key principles quality of life fairness and equity participation and partnership care for our environment and respect for ecological constraints recognising there are environmental limits and thought for the future and the precautionary principle .
learning for a sustainable future teacher centre the first and perhaps most difficult problem one that seldom gets addressed is the time a sustainable society one that endures for a decade a human lifetime or a thousand years .
the concept of social sustainability in this approach encompasses such topics as social equity livability health equity community development social capital social support human rights labour rights placemaking social responsibility social justice cultural competence community resilience and human adaptationa second more recent approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social including ecological economic political and cultural sustainability .
these domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural with the ecological domain defined as human embeddedness in the environment .
in these terms social sustainability encompasses all human activities .
nobel laureate amartya sen gives the following dimensions for social sustainability also we can speak of sustainable human development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations .
in the human development paradigm environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and in the end wellbeing .
social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by sri funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include community diversity employee relations human rights product safety reporting and governance structure .
the un guiding principles on business and human rights state that countries have the obligation to respect protect and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms and that business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable laws and respect human rights .
the un guiding principles also include a reporting framework which teaches companies how to report their interaction with human rights issues .
in addition resources like the global reporting initiative and business and human rights resource centre all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability .
responsible business conduct includes promoting workers rights and safe working conditions preventing human trafficking and addressing other human rightsrelated risks .
it is especially important for contracts with a higher risk for adverse impacts on human rights risk factors discussed below .
to understand how human rights have been addressed on previous procurements visit the responsible business case studies pagedepending on the sector certain human rights are at higher risk than others .
when sourcing from a foreign country the following resources can help you identify country specific risksif there is a high risk for adverse impacts on human rights consider using the solicitation to alert contractors to potential human rights impacts related to their supply of goods or services .
also consider using the solicitation to encourage the contractor to publicly disclose policies and procedures that minimize adverse impacts on human rights .
a useful tool that assists companies in developing such disclosures is the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights reporting framework .
due to the potential for surgical instruments to be sourced or manufactured in locations with a record of human rights violations the contractor is required to provide yes or no answers to the following questions within days after award of the contract any green bell peppers strawberries or tomatoes provided under this contract must be a participating grower in the fair food program .
for questions on procurements with a high risk for adverse impacts on human rights or labor rights you may contact hrprocurement stategovvalidate that the contractor complies with any responsible business requirements in the contract .
international principles guidelines tools and global initiatives related to business and human rightsthe following table builds upon the resources provided in appendix a to the burma reporting requirements and will incorporate additional resources as they are developed .
human factors however have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the industrial revolution and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality .
a balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas institutions and aspirations must operate .

many animals including human beings would not survive without any vegetation on earth .
the best known homeostatic mechanisms in humans and other mammals are regulators that keep the composition of the extracellular fluid or the internal environment constant especially with regard to the temperature ph osmolality and the concentrations of sodium potassium glucose carbon dioxide and oxygen .
however a great many other homeostatic mechanisms encompassing many aspects of human physiology control other entities in the body .
for instance core body temperature in humans varies during the course of the day ie .
sustainability at its simplest terms combines economics business social human environment and environmental science .
it can also been defined as the study to minimize and mitigate environmental impacts caused by human actions .
one area of sustainability that tends to be consistent across the disciplines is the identification and awareness of the associated environmental and human health impacts along the supply chain from raw materials to the final product .
the study of how policy or regulatory requirements affect the environment human health and economy is also under the field of sustainability .
the ultimate goal of sustainability is to enable an atmosphere for economic growth without adversely affecting the environment or human populationtitles within the sustainability field are wide and varied .
their skills are practical requiring a broad knowledge of sustainability issues but with an understanding of the processes of business decisions costing human resources and the organization s scope also .

sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends .
the desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system .
it has been suggested that the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of humanecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability .
citation needed sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity or human replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems .
sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity .
two years later the united nations world charter for nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged .
the term sustainable development as used by the united nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education public health and standard of living .
the ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments .
also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health .
fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species .
environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet .
sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally .
theoretically the longterm result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life .
such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support .
citation needed if the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity .
so this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal usesustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems .
it involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands herman daly .
scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a steadystate economy to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet .
several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a goldenrule steady state .
the thing that is meant to be sustained is really development not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies .
a study concluded in that knowledge manufactured and human capital health and education has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world .
a meta review in identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare .
the total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth air and water but also human interactions with these things with nature and what humans have created as their surroundings .
motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change .
this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd under the following definition ecoefficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the lifecycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity desimone and popoff .
work accidents mobbing of employees human rights abuses .
sustainability as in effects towards human resources environment and ecology has to be measured within each department of the company .
they have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics this accords with the brundtland commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triplebottomline dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society .
citation needed main page education for sustainable developmenteducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable .
this vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education an empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony .
in the however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries and not just in africa .
in the and this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights basic human needs and finally ecological issues .
