ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems .
from this perspective the economy is a subsystem of human society which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere and a gain in one sector is a loss from another .
in the case of metropolis this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant triple bottom line figure of the economy environment and the social .
another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities economy community occupational groups government environment culture and physiology .
it aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable .
the most prominent among these concepts might be the circular economy with its comprehensive support by the chinese and the european union .
there is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought including cradletocradle laws of ecology looped and performance economy regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and the blue economy .
for example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the circular economy and there are cases that require different or additional strategies like purchasing new more energy efficient equipment .
a review of a team of researchers from cambridge and tu delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy namely a conditional relation a strong conditional relation a necessary but not sufficient conditional relation a beneficial relationship a structured and unstructured subset relation a degree relation a costbenefittradeoff relation and a selective relation .
emerging economies like those of china and india aspire to the living standards of the western world as does the nonindustrialized world in general .
consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy .
this approach is supported by product stewardship and the increasing use of material flow analysis at all levels especially individual countries and the global economy .
the european union is expected to table by the end of an ambitious circular economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management ecodesign and limits on land fillson one account sustainability concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons .
a recent unep report proposes a green economy defined as one that improves human wellbeing and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital .
the report makes three key findings that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of gdp growth that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs .
when used in this way it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure .
an economy that is able to sustain gdp growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled .
consequently longterm sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total gdp remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by herman daly and others in the ecological economics communitya different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach .
community currencies associated with local exchange trading systems lets a gift economy and time banking have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment .
this theory rests on the premises that thus according to this analysis by this logic marketbased solutions to ecological crises ecological economics environmental economics green economy are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism s structural failures .
in regards of the united states of america the government and the economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment but in a problematic way .
these principles on a broader scale underpin the concept of a bioregional economy .

sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends .
the modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature .
the economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called managed sustainable development msd the concept of sustainable development has still to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development .
the environment the economy and society .
it has also been worded as economic environmental and social or ecology economy and equity .
a telling example is the european environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development .
as early as the the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems .
scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a steadystate economy to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet .
according to freemarket environmentalist john baden the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights .
therefore solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow but not at the expense of the public good .
thus environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall sustainable development in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources it makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a nonrenewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates .
for example the triple bottom line approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality .

this includes nonpoint source or diffuse pollution such as sediment pollution from construction sitesaustralia ranks second place on the un human development index and one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios of the developed economies .
the economy functions within and is dependent upon goods and services provided by natural ecosystems .
with the prevalence of environmental problems many economists embraced the notion that if environmental sustainability must coexist for economic sustainability then the overall system must permit identification of an equilibrium between the environment and the economy .
for someone who believes natural capital is infinite and easily substituted environmental management is irrelevant to the economy .
