by david doylein june parts of eastern iowa were devastated by a flood the second such event in years .
total losses from the flooding were estimated at nearly billionflooding in eastern iowa june disaster s greatest impact was on cedar rapids where more than homes and almost businesses were damaged or destroyed .
however the flood also affected dozens of other communities along the des moines cedar iowa and mississippi rivers and their many tributariesmy role in tornado recoverythe previous year i had been assigned to work with the federal emergency management agency s fema s longterm community recovery efforts in response to the tornado that devastated greensburg kan .
this was my first opportunity to participate in a longterm recovery effort in response to a natural disasteraftermath of iowa flooding june s traditional role after disasters primarily had been responding to the threat and impacts from the release of hazardous materials along with addressing the impacts on community water and wastewater systems .
longterm recovery was a relatively new role for epa and involved providing assistance with sustainable community planning to make a community more sustainable and resilient to future disastersmy role in greensburg was to help fema develop the longterm community recovery plan which was completed after several months of work and quickly implemented eventually making greensburg arguably the greenest city in the countryin i was again assigned to work with fema in iowa on postdisaster sustainable longterm planning efforts .
i quickly realized that making such plans after a flood was very different than for a tornadoa very different experiencewhile greensburg was a onesquaremile city much of iowa was impacted in one way or another by this flood .
fortunately then governor chet culver established a state government agency called the rebuild iowa office which spent considerable time immediately after the disaster working with fema to determine the longterm recovery needs of communitiesflooding in eastern iowa june learning from my experience in greensburg i started to reach out to various epa headquarters offices looking for assistance knowing there was no funding available from epa region to assist with the needed recovery planningi quickly found that epa s offices of sustainable communities and brownfields land revitalization were willing partners .
both provided funding to bring in technical experts on economic development transportation planning and sustainable urban designiowa city makes the most of epa s assistancethe iowa community that took most advantage of these resources was iowa city the state s fourth largest city and home to the university of iowa and a major medical center .
for years the city had been looking to redevelop an area south of their downtown .
the flood gave them an opportunity to do just thatthis area renamed the riverfront crossings district includes an aging wastewater treatment plant recycling center animal shelter and various other underutilized properties many of which were impacted by the floodingdiagram from epa s enhancing sustainable communities with green infrastructure after conducting a retail and housing market analysis along with a transitoriented development study both commissioned by epa it was decided that this area could be transformed into a mixeduse pedestrian and transitfriendly neighborhood .
again utilizing epa funding contractors with expertise in sustainable urban planning initiated a process to develop conceptual plans for such a neighborhood .
after considerable interaction with local stakeholders epa finalized these plans in may epa s involvementas it takes years not only for plans to be finalized from conception but also for them to be implemented i recently asked karen howard iowa city s assistant planning director to update me on what has happened in the community since epa s involvementshe said a riverfront crossings district master plan was adopted in along with a formbased zoning code for the district in one of the recommendations from the initial epa technical assistance grant illustration of riverfront crossings district restoration after removal of wastewater plantsince the formbased code was adopted private investment in new construction totaled about million with many projects still under construction and another to million in private investment is in the planning stages .
this is only a small fraction of the redevelopment potential of the riverfront crossings district that howard expects in the coming yearsnew private building projects include two new hotels a class a office building standalone restaurant convenience storegas station craft brewery multifamily and mixeduse buildings with ground floor retail space and a considerable number of residential apartments and condominiumspublic investment in the district includes the decommissioned and demolished floodprone wastewater treatment plant the first phase of a new riverfront park a public parking facility under construction new ambulance and medical examiners offices under construction and a new university of iowa school of music completed in fall .
a number of street improvement projects are also in the planning stagesthe old saying with disaster brings opportunity certainly couldn t be more applicable to the sustainable recovery efforts that rejuvenated iowa city after the flood of the author david doyle serves as the sustainable communities coordinator at epa region .

the exterior of via verde showing off its stepped roofby john martinfor people old enough to remember it s hard to believe how far the bronx has come since the and the south bronx lost over residents as crime spiked and people made way for the suburbs .
the borough became synonymous with urban decay a stigma it continues to fight decades after it began its dramatic reboundtoday the bronx is flourishing as the public and private sectors continue to make the borough a healthier and more pleasant place to live .
it s hard to find a better example of how far the borough has come than via the mixedincome housing development in the melrose neighborhood that opened in .
since then it has earned international acclaim for its bold design and its focus on creating a green urban environment for its residentsthe project which sits on a cleanedup former rail yard provides units of living space views of the manhattan skyline and healthyliving amenities galore .
a string of green roofs dot the building s terraces as do solar panels which provide electricity to all the building s common spaces .
residents have access to shared gardening beds a children s playground a fitness center and an outdoor amphitheater .
throw in the building s easy access to subway and bus lines and it becomes easy to understand why via verde has been held up as a model for environmentally sustainable developmentas of today we can add the epa to the list of those who have officially recognized via verde s accomplishments .
this morning the epa announced that via verde received an honorable mention for the national award for smart growth achievement in the category of built projects .
of the smart growth achievement applications the epa received from across the country via verde was just one of seven to be recognizedfor a borough that has come so far and fought so long to create livable thriving communities via verde is a crowning achievement and an inspiration to urban areas everywhereto read more about via verde and the other projects receiving national award for smart growth achievement visit http wwwepagovsmartgrowthawardshtmeditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .

by betty kreakie phdepa s betty kreakie phd in surinamemanaging big data is difficultwell let me rephrase that slightly managing highquality big environmental data is really really difficultbut you may ask if it is so difficult why bother .
because if you are able to successfully generate and manage highquality environmental data in a geographic information system gis you can save the rainforest .
and the world this was the sales pitch i used during my embassy science fellowship in paramaribo suriname .
suriname is a small country located just north of brazil .
the goal of my three month fellowship was to assist the ministerie van ruimtelijke ordening grond en bosbeheer rgb ministry of physical planning land and forestry management with the development of a spatial data management plan .
rgb is a relatively new ministry founded in and faces the same daunting concerns as many other land management agencies such as limited resources and high workloads .
incorporating new data management concepts into an established busy agency is challenging .
and for a country that is still pristine rainforest environmental data management will be critical for sustaining growth while preserving natural resourcesmy efforts focused on three main areas to build a strong data management foundation strategic data planning logistics and organization and implementing new softwarestechnologies .
first strategic data planning helps ensure that data collection is in line with specific management goals and the agency s mission .
second having logistical protocols in place that explicitly state how data are collected and processed increases efficiency and reduces confusion .
and finally i introduced some new costeffective software that would help streamline data processing and increase quality controlto those who attended my workshops this material was not immediately compelling .
for some reason people do not find data management beguiling .
and this is where my sales pitch came into play .
building a highquality database of environmental information in suriname will allow land managers to preserve their amazing natural resources while still allowing for development opportunitieswith big environmental data suriname can achieve true sustainable development while preserving one of the world s few last intact rainforestsabout the author betty kreakie phd is a research ecologist for the us environmental protection agency s office of research and development in narragansett rhode island .

a few days ago i arrived in rio de janeiro brazil for the united nation s conference on sustainable development aka .
.
i m excited and humbled to be a part of this milestone event which marks the anniversary of the first un earth summit .
offers an important opportunity to consider anew the global challenge of sustainable development and to provide guidance and inspiration for the path ahead .
while i m here in rio in addition to attending itself i ll be participating in many satellite events designed to make the most of this opportunity .
just a few examples on june i was also given the opportunity to moderate the environmental governance and social inclusion program at the us center in athletes park .
it was a successful and lively discussion with an extremely well qualified panel and an engaged audience .
some of the issues we touched on included i think these concepts are integral to the notion of sustainability .
after all when we talk about environmental governance we are talking about the very real building blocks of a governance system that can make all the difference in the difference between the concept of environmental protection expressed as written law and the reality of cleaner air and water healthier people and a secure a future where these benefits can be sustained for future generationsand when we talk about environmental justice we are talking about the kind of social inclusion that allows us to reach an end state where no one s environmental health is compromised because of his or her race national origin or income level and all have equal access both to the environmental decisionmaking process and to a healthy environment in which to live learn and workto read more about environmental governance click here http ineceorgresourcefoundationabout the author scott fulton is the us environmental protection agency s general counseleditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .

recently i was listening to a radio show in which commentators were talking about the anniversary of the lunar landing .
i remember that evening very well .
i watched the images of that historic milestone with my great grandmother in puerto rico .
she was then and we discussed how the world had changed during her lifetime .
she described seeing the arrival of the first cars to the island .
she contrasted those developments with the newsbreaking story of that evening on july when the first man landed on the moon .
looking back to these years we ve witnessed great technological advances and innovations we now take for granted .
travel in space communications and nanotechnology are just some of the things that have changed in the past forty years .
and that brings me to the subject todayi ve always been attracted to the concept of the future .
in the sixties i remember going to the world fair in new york and watching several exhibits which forecasted how life was going to be in the century .
in fact one of my favorite cartoons the jetsons was an animated science fiction sitcom which portrayed life in the century as conceived by the producers back in .
there were robots electronic contraptions and flying cars .
if you come to think about it other than the flying cars some of their futuristic ideas have become a reality .
however in remembering this series i noticed something recently which made me pause and think .
there was hardly any vegetation in that future there were hardly any trees .
no greenery .
is that how life will become in the century when you come to think about it a future without trees or vegetation would not only be scary but deadly for all mankind .
many animals including human beings would not survive without any vegetation on earth .
plants are necessary for multiple provide us with oxygen and they are at the foundation of all food chains .
furthermore they play a fundamental role in cleanse the atmosphere of excessively large quantities of carbon dioxide emissions .
so when we think of sustainable development and environmental protection these are not the fads of the moment .
they are essential to our survival .
we can all start working to protect our planet by pledging to take action in favor of our planet on earth day and every dayabout the author lina younes has been working for epa since and chairs epa s multilingual communications task force .
