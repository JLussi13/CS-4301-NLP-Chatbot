environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals organizations and governments .
its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and where possible to repair damage and reverse trends due to the pressures of overconsumption population growth and technology the biophysical environment is being degraded sometimes permanently .
this has been recognized and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation .
since the environmental movements have created more awareness of the various environmental problems .
there is no agreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity and even scientific dishonesty occurs so protection measures are occasionally debatedin industrial countries voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of best environmental practice .
for instance in india environment improvement trust eit has been working for environmental and forest protection since .
a group of green volunteers get a goal of green india clean india concept .
ca gajendra kumar jain a chartered accountant is the founder of environment improvement trust in sojat city a small village of state of rajasthan in india in developing countries such as latin america these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of noncompliance with mandatory regulation .
the challenges that exist with these agreements lie in establishing baseline data targets monitoring and reporting .
due to the difficulties inherent in evaluating effectiveness their use is often questioned and indeed the whole environment may well be adversely affected as a result .
the key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity .
an ecosystems approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges .
ideally the decisionmaking processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments as well as representatives of industry environmental groups and community .
this approach ideally supports a better exchange of information development of conflictresolution strategies and improved regional conservation .
religions also play an important role in conservation of environment .

many of the earth s resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across many countries .
as a result of this many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources .
this can include agreements that impact factors such as climate oceans rivers and air pollution .
these international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and at other times are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct .
these agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as in europe america and africa .
some of the most wellknown international agreements include the kyoto protocol and othersdiscussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government legislation and law enforcement .
however in its broadest sense environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government .
decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry indigenous groups environmental group and community representatives .
gradually environmental decisionmaking processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries .
many constitutions acknowledge the fundamental right to environmental protection and many international treaties acknowledge the right to live in a healthy environment .
also many countries have organizations and agencies devoted to environmental protection .
there are international environmental protection organizations such as the united nations environment programmealthough environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of government protection acts most people view these agencies as being of prime importance in establishing and maintaining basic standards that protect both the environment and the people interacting with ittanzania is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any african country .
almost of the land has been established into a network of protected areas including several national parks .
the concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth expansion of subsistence agriculture pollution timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel .
environmental protection in tanzania began during the german occupation of east africa colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting firewood collecting and cattle grazing .
in year serengeti was officially established the first national park for wild cats in east africa .
since there has been a more broadreaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level through the establishment of the national environment management council nemc and the development of an environmental act .
in environment improvement trust eit start working for environment forest protection in india from a small city sojat .
founder of environment improvement trust is ca gajendra kumar jain working with volunteers .
division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection .
it does this through the formulation of policy coordinating and monitoring environmental issues environmental planning and policyoriented environmental researchthe national environment management council nemc is an institution that was initiated when the national environment management act was first introduced in year .
this council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues .
the nemc the following purposes provide technical advice coordinate technical activities develop enforcement guidelines and procedures assess monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment promote and assist environmental information and communication and seek advancement of scientific knowledge .
the national environment policy of acts as a framework for environmental decision making in tanzania .
the policy objectives are to achieve the following use ecofriendly resourcestanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the rio declaration on development and environment and the convention on biological diversity .
the environmental management act is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmentalmanagement decisions .
the policy tools that are parts of the act includes the use of environmentalimpact assessments strategics environmentals assessments and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products .
the effectiveness of shifing of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that historically there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmentalprotection objectives into practiceformal environmental protection in china house was first stimulated by the united nations conference on the human environment held in stockholm sweden .
following this they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste .
china was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy .
in the state council announced that environmental protection would be one of china s basic national policies and in the national environmental protection agency nepa was established .
following severe flooding of the yangtze river basin in nepa was upgraded to the state environmental protection agency sepa meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level .
in sepa became known by its current name of ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china mep .
environmental pollution and ecological degradation has resulted in economic losses for china .
in economic losses mainly from air pollution were calculated at of china s gdp .
this grew to by and the economic loss from water pollution began to exceed that caused by air pollution .
china has been one of the top performing countries in terms of gdp growth in the past ten years .
however the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that china faces are greater than most countries .
in china was ranked out of countries on the environmental performance indexchina has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation rapid growth in gdp has been china s main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high gdp .
for china to develop sustainably environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies .
quote from shengxian zhou head of mep good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure production form and develop model .
environmental protection has become an important task for the institutions of the european community after the maastricht treaty for the european union ratification by all the member states .
the eu is already very active in the field of environmental policy with important directives like those on environmental impact assessment and on the access to environmental information for citizens in the member statesin russia environmental protection is considered an integral part of national safety .
there is an authorized state body the federal ministry of natural resources and ecology .
however there are a lot of environmental problemsthe united nations environment programme unep has identified megadiverse countries .
the list includes six latin american countries brazil colombia ecuador mexico peru and venezuela .
mexico and brazil stand out among the rest because they have the largest area population and number of species .
these countries represent a major concern for environmental protection because they have high rates of deforestation ecosystems loss pollution and population growthbrazil has the largest amount of the world s tropical forests of brazil concentrated in the amazon region .
brazil is home to vast biological diversity first among the megadiverse countries of the world having between of the million globally described species .
the organization in charge of environment protection is the brazilian ministry of the environment in portuguese ministério do meio ambiente mma .
it was first created in year with the name special secretariat for the environment secretaria especial de meio ambiente changing names several times and adopting the final name in year .
the ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues in protected areas of the amazon covered an area larger than greenland with conservation units like national parks accounting for just over half and indigenous territories representing the remaining .
with over different species mexico is home to of the world s biodiversity ranking first in reptile biodiversity and second in mammals estimate indicates that over of all animal and plant species live in mexico .
the history of environmental policy in mexico started in the with the enactment of the law of conservation of soil and water in spanish ley de conservación de suelo y agua .
three decades later at the beginning of the the law to prevent and control environmental pollution was created ley para prevenir y controlar la contaminación ambiental in year was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues .
it established the administrative organization of the secretariat for the improvement of the environment subsecretaría para el mejoramiento del ambiente in the department of health and welfarethe secretariat of environment and natural resources secretaría del medio ambiente y recursos naturales semarnat is mexico s environment ministry .
the ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues in november there were protected areas currently there are covering an area of hectares increasing federally protected areas from to its land area .
in there was ha of terrestrial protected area covering of the land area of australia .
the figures of of terrestrial area and ha of protected marine area were found to poorly represent about half of australia s bioregions .
environmental protection in australia could be seen as starting with the formation of the first national park royal national park in .
more progressive environmental protection had it start in the and with major international programs such as the united nations conference on the human environment in the environment committee of the oecd in and the united nations environment programme of .
these events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation .
state environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the australian environment council aec and council of nature conservation ministers concom were established in and creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries .
these councils have since been replaced by the australian and new zealand environment and conservation council anzecc in and finally the environment protection and heritage council ephc in .
at a national level the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act is the primary environmental protection legislation for the commonwealth of australia .
it concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora fauna ecological communities and cultural heritage .
it also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the commonwealth or affecting it that has significant environmental impact .
the act covers eight main areas there are several commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners such as kakadu national park extraordinary biodiversity such as christmas island national park or managed cooperatively due to crossstate location such as the australian alps national parks and reserves .
at a state level the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory .
each state in australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies .
their jurisdiction is similar and covers pointsource pollution such as from industry or commercial activities landwater use and waste management .
most protected lands are managed by states and territories with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness national land and marine parks state forests and conservation areas .
states also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air water and sound pollutionat a local level each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation .
this includes nonpoint source or diffuse pollution such as sediment pollution from construction sitesaustralia ranks second place on the un human development index and one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios of the developed economies .
this could be seen as coming at the cost of the environment with australia being the world leader in coal exportation and species extinctions .
some have been motivated to proclaim it is australia s responsibility to set the example of environmental reform for the rest of the world to follow .
at a national level the ministry for the environment is responsible for environmental policy and the department of conservation addresses conservation issues .
at a regional level the regional councils administer the legislation and address regional environmental issuesthe environmental protection in switzerland is mainly based on the measures to be taken against global warming .
the pollution in switzerland is mainly the pollution caused by vehicles and the litteration by touristssince the united states environmental protection agency epa has been working to protect the environment and human health .
all us states have their own state departments of environmental protection .
the epa has drafted seven priorities for epa s future which are there are many works of literature that contain the themes of environmental protection but some have been fundamental to its evolution .
several pieces such as a sand county almanac by aldo leopold tragedy of the commons by garrett hardin and silent spring by rachel carson have become classics due to their far reaching influences .
citation needed environmental protection is present in fiction as well as nonfictional literature .
books such as antarctica and blockade have environmental protection as subjects whereas the lorax has become a popular metaphor for environmental protection .
the limits of trooghaft by desmond stewart is a short story that provides insight into human attitudes towards animals .
another book called the martian chronicles by ray bradbury investigates issues such as bombs wars government control and what effects these can have on the environment .
