by sophia rinii usually avoid travelling for the entire time between thanksgiving and new year s .
but occasionally it s unavoidable .
despite taking public transportation to work every day just one holiday season and it seems like i ve undone all my good climate karma .
the fact is that for those of us who aren t lucky enough to have family nearby sometimes flying is the only option .
to help my fellow airborne travelers with their jumbojet sized guilt i did some research on how to minimize our environmental impacts even while travelling in the most unecofriendly of waysalthough some of the suggestions below might seem small since almost onequarter of all travel occurs during the holiday season if everyone followed them the impacts would certainly add uptips for decreasing the environmental impact of flying the urban garden at chicago s o hare international airport provides vegetables to the airport restaurantsdo you have any suggestions for decreasing the environmental impact of airline travel .

even the smallest of balconies can host a few plants and add some much needed greenery to the urban jungleby sion leei have always had an affinity for all things green .
i love the feeling of cool grass beneath my bare feet the smell of the bouquet of roses sitting on my kitchen table the gracefulness of a weeping i am easily enamored by plants and trees .
the new york botanical garden is my favorite place to be ever .
it is not a surprising confession then when i say that one of my goals in life is to have a huge garden where i can plant my own collection of greensit s slightly difficult however to maintain such a garden in new york city .
while it is true that certain boroughs have more space than others basically all boroughs except manhattan space is limited and expensive .
as a resident of queens new york city i am fortunate enough to live in a building that has a balcony .
the balcony is made of concrete but it has enough space to place potted plants and small trees .
my family grows green peppers and ruby red cherry tomatoes each year .
yes they re delicious but they are not enough to quench my need for seedthis is where community gardens come into play .
a community garden is selfexplanatory it is a garden for the people created by the people .
it is not uncommon for vacant lots to turn into community gardens .
it is place where the people living in the community can come together to grow fresh produce .
a community garden has many environmental and health benefits .
for one more plants would mean more oxygen restored into the air .
this would reduce air pollution which is especially crucial in highly polluted urban areas .
participating in a community garden would also increase environmental awarenesslocally grown fruits and vegetables are often said to taste better and to be better for the environment .
while there have not been any comprehensive studies to support these claims i believe that just reaping what you have sowed is a truly more rewarding experience than buying produce from chain grocery stores .
furthermore while buying locally might be more expensive than regular produce growing your own food is the cheapest option of all .
this has a great health implication for people of lower socioeconomic standing community gardens make healthier foods more accessible to those who usually can not afford itbesides community gardens are fun .
they allow you to interact with people from your community who share the same green interests as you do .
having a strong sense of community can create an opportunity for neighborhood crime rates to decrease .

the welcome return of spring sunshine makes me think of one thing grimy winterweary windows .
and then there s the fridge the baseboards the carpets the bathroom grout the kitchen cabinets .
all these little spots we ignored all winter are now ready for a thorough scrub .
no wonder nearly percent of americans like to do a good spring cleaninggood thing you can use the epa safer choice label to help you find cleaning and other household products that are made with ingredients that are safer for people and the environmentthat s a great assurance considering household cleaning products are one source of indoor air pollution which can cause irritation of the eyes nose and throat headaches dizziness and fatigueproducts with safer ingredients improve indoor air quality and can lower the risk of health hazards including respiratory conditions like asthma allergic reactions which can cause skin rashes hives or headaches and a variety of other conditions .
children and older people in particular are more susceptible to risks so they re better off in spaces cleaned with safer products and wearing clothes cleaned with a laundry detergent that uses safer solvents and surfactants .
and what about parents and those who regularly clean and do the wash coming in close contact with cleaners and detergents .
safer is certainly better for them .
safer choice recognizes that everyday cleaning products make a big difference to your family s wellbeingcleaners also affect the quality of our local streams rivers and lakes .
when safer choice products get rinsed down the drain and make their way into the watershed they are less toxic to fish and other aquatic life .
that s good news for new england s iconic waterways whether it s lake champlain the charles river or long island or the ponds streams and wetlands found throughout new englandhere s something that may surprise you .
unlike food producers cleaning product manufacturers are not required to list ingredients on their containers or make them public .
but to display the safer choice label manufacturers must list all of their product s ingredients either on the product or on an easyaccess websitesafer choice is the first federal label for cleaning products and it is proving incredibly popular .
more than products have already earned the right to carry the logo .
they re available in local grocery stores and hardware stores and include cleaners for use at home offices schools hotels and sports venuesthe agency s website https wwwepagovsaferchoice lists all the products that proudly carry the safer choice label .
we also offer interactive tools to find the best cleaning products for your home and for businesses like schools hotels offices and sports venues .

by wendy dewi ve spent a lot of time in leadville colorado .
also known as the twomilehigh city leadville is the highest incorporated city and the second highest incorporated municipality in the united states .
in the late century leadville was the second most populous city in colorado after denverbut what i know most about leadville is epa s work on cleaning up the california gulch superfund site and a local conservation group s efforts to educate citizens on energy and environmental issuesthe california gulch site covers square miles in lake county including leadville and a section of the arkansas river .
former mining operations contributed to metals contamination in surface water groundwater soil and sediment .
over the years epa has worked with the state the local community and the site s potentially responsible parties to clean up the site coordinate ecological restoration work and redevelop specific portions of the sitewhile there are still portions of the site that are being cleaned up miles of the upper arkansas river have been restored and the area was added to the gold medal trout waters in colorado .
these fishing areas are noted by colorado wildlife commission as places where trout are plentiful and larger .
the designation has been years in the making and although anglers have enjoyed the improved conditions for years it is an official acknowledgement of the myriad efforts by state and federal agencies local governments and stakeholders to turn an impaired river into one of the most popular fishing destinations in coloradogold medal waters are not the only great environmental happenings in leadville .
the cloud city conservation center was awarded two epa grants for environmental justice work and environmental education work .
i got the chance to visit and see firsthand how they are making a difference in the communitythe environmental justice project focused on helping lowincome and minority residents in lake county reduce energy use and address underinsulated and leaky housing .
it focused specifically on residents who have limited access to information due to language barriers immigration status and other hurdles facing this ej population .
conducted workshops using epa grant funds to educate the community about conservation and efficiency measures they could implement in their homes to save energy and money .
thirty home energy audits and follow up support services provided participants the opportunity to improve the energy efficiency of their homes while becoming more knowledgeable about energy conservationvent that is corroding due to corrosive combustion gases coming from the boileras a result of this initiative the community enjoys lower greenhouse gas emissions and more comfortable homes .
additionally the impact of global climate change is addressed through local solutions thereby empowering the community to make a difference on the sustainability of our environmentthe environmental education project awarded in seeks to make lake county youth the environmental leaders of the community ultimately expanding lake county s capacity for environmental stewardship .
approximately lake county students will increase their environmental understanding through daily composting and hands on educationthis will increase capacity in each lake county school to reduce waste reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a valuable environmental product establishing a model program for the community as a whole .
the compost will be used in a future greenhouse project for the local schools .
the kids who are involved in managing the compost bins are incredible proud of the positive local environmental impact they are having at their schoolthe transformation from mines to parks gold medal trout waters environmental justice initiatives and future environmental leaders is impressive .
visiting grantees is one of my favorite things to do in my job .
it gives me a chance to see for myself all the great work epa grant funds make possible .
talking to kids who are excited about the environmental changes they are making is amazing .
it motivates me and makes me feel like i am part of a very large movement to restore protect and improve our environment .

by gina snyderthis is a year of anniversaries for the boston harbor and islands .
twentyfive years ago the massachusetts water resources authority announced that no more sludge would be dumped into the harbor .
after over years of discharges to the harbor this was a real milestone and it opened the way for the boston harbor islands to become a unit of the national park system years ago .
and just a decade ago spectacle island reclaimed from a former landfill was opened for visitorswhile the first national park was created on march it wasn t until years ago this year that we had a national park service .
what better way to celebrate the first national park and the anniversary of the park service than for new englanders to visit the island jewels in boston harbor and celebrate the environmental milestones at the same time .
ferries run in summer to some of the islands in the park including spectacle island and george s island wwwnpsgovboha visiting our national parks is a great way to enjoy nature .
as of this year massachusetts has sixteen national park locations wwwnpsgovma among twentyseven national parks plus several national historic sites and scenic trails in all of new england .
ranging from small historic sites to a long public footpath known as the appalachian national scenic trail that runs from maine to georgia these parks give you a variety of choices for celebrating the centennialif it s a small historic site you want why not head to jfk s birthplace in brookline or washington s headquarters at the longfellow house in cambridge .
and if it s a wilderness hike in nature check out one or all miles of the appalachian trail as it runs through the scenic wooded pastoral wild and culturally resonant lands of the appalachian mountains through connecticut massachusetts vermont new hampshire and mainenew hampshire connecticut and vermont each have one national park weir farm national historic site in connecticut saintgaudens national historic site in new hampshire and marshbillingsrockefeller national historical park in vermont .
maine and rhode island each have two sites .
in maine wellknown acadia national park and saint croix island international historic site home of the earliest french presence in north america .
and in rhode island roger williams national memorial in providence and touro synagogue national historic site in newportcelebrating our national parks lets us get outside to enjoy the environment .
here in the boston area it s an advantage that you can get to many of our nearby parks by public transit .
the three right in boston are easily accessible besides the harbor islands boston s national historic park is at faneuil hall wwwnpsgovbost and the boston african american national historic site and meeting house is centered on the north slope of beacon hill wwwnpsgovboaf in this year of centennial celebration for the national park service you are invited to get out and find your park wwwnpsgovsubjectscentennialfindyourparkhtm but with the success of the boston harbor clean up you can get out and find your the author gina snyder works in the office of environmental stewardship compliance assistance at epa new england and serves on her town s climate committeeeditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .

by barbara pualaniepa identifies stormwater as the number one threat to our waterways .
stormwater pollution is the result of development and the heavy use of impervious materials such as concrete and metals in our everyday construction .
these surfaces discourage water from soaking into the ground so when it rains stormwater runs off these surfaces and into our water bodies carrying solid waste and pollution with it .
green infrastructure provides an effective solution to the stormwater pollution problem by taking advantage of nature s inherent properties .
by using pervious surfaces that allow water to soak into the ground pollutants can be filtered out before entering waterways .
in a joint project nassau county soil and water conservation district and new york state department of environmental conservation produced an educational film stormwater pollution and green infrastructure shown below in order to highlight this very important issue .
director of the clean water division at epa region joan matthews featured in the video touts the success of green infrastructure projects everywhere green infrastructure works and it helps to reduce pollutants watch learn enjoy we all have a role to play in reducing stormwater pollutionto learn more and for more stormwater education resources visit wwwnassauswcdorgabout the author barbara pualani serves as a speechwriter for epa region .

by jennie saxethis time of year you might find me sampling the last of our valentine s day chocolates or cooking up a hearty stew enough to ensure there will be leftovers for my busy family .
in past blogs we ve written about the water footprint of our food and ways that sustainable food management protects water resources .
this got me thinking how much water goes into producing some of my family s favorite foods you can calculate the water footprint of your favorite foodsafter doing a little research i found that there s a lot of water hidden in my goto chicken stew recipe the chicken alone about lbs .
of it requires around gallons of water to produce .
that s enough water to fill about bathtubs .
if my famous beef stew were on the menu the same amount of beef requires almost quadruple the amount of water bathtubs worth .
and believe it or not those valentine s day chocolates have the largest water footprint on the menu it takes a whopping gallons of water to produce a standardsized chocolate bar .
according to epa s watersense program that s more water than an average american family of four uses in one dayfortunately there are ways to reduce the water footprint of your favorite meals .
buying only what you need for your recipes reduces potential food waste and minimizes the waste of everything that went into producing the food including water you can also look for foods that are locallygrown .
lower transportation needs for local food translate into a smaller environmental footprint overall .
community supported agriculture csa and urban gardens are great ways to support your community and get healthy local foods .

maurice strong secretarygeneral of of the earth summit talking in the special ceremony to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of rio earth summit .
rio de janeiro brazil .
jun .
un photomaria elisa francoon november maurice strong of canada died at the age of .
no one deserves more credit than him for advancing the goals of sustainability .
delegates at the recent paris climate conference payed tribute to his vision and accomplishmentshe organized the stockholm conference in subtitled only one earth and the rio earth summit in subtitled our last chance to save the earth the stockholm conference is recognized as a major landmark in launching a new era of international environmental diplomacy .
after the summit he served as the first executive director of the united nations environment programme unep his leadership in was crucial to beginning to address a host of emerging threats to the natural environment and advancing the critical role of the united nations .
he was clever enough to commission an historic study only one earth by barbara ward and rene dubos which underscored the growing industrial stressors on the environment and depletion of natural resources .
this was the first state of the world reportthe report was the first to emphasize the potential for depletion of natural resources and to project that the impacts of global population growth and urban development would be critical lessons of world history .
the report was a flashing yellow light of caution .
today global population is projected to be billion by and billion by with more people living in cities than ever before .
this has prompted the current un secretary general ban kimoon to note that our struggle for global sustainability will be won or lost in cities today this is a flashing red lighttwenty years later maurice strong was key in organizing the rio earth summit .
it was there that the head of the us delegation epa administrator bill reilly and i met with him .
since then he played a key role in many un activities helping to advance a more sustainable and resilient world .
in his book in where on earth are we going he predicted that in three decades environmental catastrophes could wipe out as much as twothirds of the world s population .
he strongly pushed for businessgovernment collaboration to get out front on key issue .
after the earth summit strong continued to take a leading role in implementing the results of rio through dozens of international organizationsover his life time he strongly advanced the concept of sustainability .
unfortunately what he advanced in and is still an issue today .
today achieving the goal of sustainability is even more urgent .
while it has taken decades to reach this point there is a need for accelerated action due to pressures and trends that will impact society over the coming decades .
it is here that epa can help shape and protect the future worldabout the author alan hecht is the director for sustainable development in epa s office of research and developmenteditor s note the views expressed here are intended to explain epa policy .
