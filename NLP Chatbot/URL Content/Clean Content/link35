policy .
executive departments and agencies agencies have been among our nation s leaders as the united states works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come .
federal leadership in energy environmental water fleet buildings and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change .
through a combination of more efficient federal operations such as those outlined in this executive order order we have the opportunity to reduce agency direct greenhouse gas emissions by at least percent over the next decade while at the same time fostering innovation reducing spending and strengthening the communities in which our federal facilities operateit therefore continues to be the policy of the united states that agencies shall increase efficiency and improve their environmental performance .
improved environmental performance will help us protect our planet for future generations and save taxpayer dollars through avoided energy costs and increased efficiency while also making federal facilities more resilient .
to improve environmental performance and federal sustainability priority should first be placed on reducing energy use and cost then on finding renewable or alternative energy solutions .
pursuing clean sources of energy will improve energy and water security while ensuring that federal facilities will continue to meet mission requirements and lead by example .
employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across federal operations and the federal supply chainsec .
